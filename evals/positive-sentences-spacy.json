  "Great mix, but it bothers me a bit in the vocals, something in the low-mid. Otherwise, very well done. In terms of effects and spatiality, this is really good. In my opinion, the drums could be a bit more present.",
  "Very nice mix and balance. Unfortunately, no real comments :)",
  "Not the best but certainly not bad.",
  "Beautiful balance, good EQ, not excessive with reverb, but lacks a bit of freshness.",
  "The vocals come in quite abruptly during the chorus but are better in terms of balance. Reverb on the snare sounds nice. This mix sounds more open than mix 1 and 4 and is better in terms of balance. Toms are well balanced compared to the rest of the drums.",
  "Mix sounds right. Nice spatial image but the snare is a bit small. Sounds quite distant.",
  "I would personally use less reverb, and especially a different patch. It could also use a bit more brightness and less muddiness; it doesn't necessarily sound open.",
  "The vocals have good effects but are slightly too loud at some moments. The EQ on the vocals is also well done. Maybe add a bit more compression on the vocals. The song itself lacks a bit of power. Drums are also relatively quiet.",
  "Very narrow stereo width, vocals are too prominent",
  "Nice but some panning should be added to all the instruments (very similar to track 3)",
  "A bit too much reverb for my taste. Quite punchy and clear mix though. Vocals dominate too much over the instruments. Good build up to the chorus which sounds more energetic than the verse as it should be. A bit more guitar would be welcome.",
  "Well balanced and spread out. Vocals clear and with nice space from the reverb. Could have more energy in build-up to chorus.",
  "good, but compared to others less rich . voice very over the rest",
  "Hard to make out the lyrics. Vocals should be louder. Nice balance otherwise",
  "there is a high cut here but I can't pin point the main characteristic of this mix. In the beginning vocals are not very well mixed but it gets better in the second section of the mix. Fair mix but lacks excitement",
  "maybe the EQ balance affected and mixed all these sound sources together, not bad",
  "This lacks punch as well, although I find it better than the first two. The whole mix is not very loud and the guitar is not distinctive enough",
  "Background vocals very prominent, Vocals overall a bit too prominent in comparison to remaining instruments. A very interesting mix",
  "Very cool mix, sounds lively and clean, maybe a bit too clean. I also miss the organ that plays a few notes here and there. The drums have a lot of punch, in my opinion, maybe too much for this type of music, but that's subjective. Overall, well done.",
  "Good combination of drums and bass. They stay nicely in their place, defined mix, sounds open. Vocals are well-balanced with the rest. This is probably my favorite, and I find it radio-worthy. Time and effort have been put into it, and a good understanding of the music.",
  "The guitars are quite loud compared to the vocals. Otherwise, the balance is okay.",
  "Nice balance and stereo image. Sometimes, there's a bit too much effects on the vocals in my opinion. If that were toned down a bit, the vocals would come forward more in the mix.",
  "Lot of bass; live feel, not much vocal/clear; Overall louder! Strange reverb (too long?), Bass slightly too loud. Energy comes across well.",
  "In this chorus, I hear a guitar that I almost don't hear in the other mixes. Drum and bass carry the song quite well, better than the rest. Guitar sounds cool. The vocals, in my opinion, are just not compressed well enough. This chorus is the best.",
  "Beautiful balance.",
  "The mix is good. The proportions are okay, and the song sounds present. The effect on the vocals also suits the song well. Perhaps a bit too much guitar during the verses.",
  "-Sounds good! The drums have impact, there's enough low-mid (a problem in many). -Balance is good. -The slapback delay on the lead doesn't work 100%.",
  "Nice but some panning should be added to all the instruments",
  "Punchy and clear mix but too much drums especially during intro of the verses. Not sure the selected reverb for the vocals fits the recording (too roomy). Panning could be better used to spread things more in the sound field.",
  "Similar to track 1. Reverb on vocals help to bed the track together. However sometime vocals get too quiet and cannot hear some lyrics. Drums are nice and punchy.",
  "it seems good, live room effect maybe too much. I like the guitar",
  "very similar to 6 but the voice has a higher energy and presence. Looks like it does not have enough gain",
  "I think there is a little much rev on the vocals at points, so maybe some automation or even a compressor? - the reverb isn't quite right. but the overall balance is nice",
  "This one is like a soup of tracks",
  "sounds like the vocal is far away from me, maybe it ought to increase the volume of the vocal part",
  "There is a bizarre reverb on this one, as if it was already played in a specific room. The instruments are covering the vocals too.",
  "Tight drums + bass. The guitars are nicely placed around that. The vocals might have a bit too much effect for this sound. I could, however, agree with the mix and balance.",
  "This mix relies entirely on the atmospheric verses with the delay and vocals, but in the choruses, you expect more tangible elements. The guitars, in particular, are placed so quietly that the energy and harmonic information are lacking. In mono, the overall atmosphere is retained due to the delay on the vocals, but the mix loses some of its strength, especially highlighting the lack of bass and guitars.",
  "In this mix, there's quite a lot of vocals, and they're quite loud. I sometimes miss some guitar. The tambourine is quite loud compared to the rest of the drums. I miss energy in the drums and the whole song. It doesn't come together well in my opinion. I like the sound of the little guitar in the chorus. I appreciate that the vocals are not too dry, but it's a bit too much.",
  "Maybe a bit too much vocals. Guitars fade away towards the chorus. Quite a bit of reverb (too large space). Sound is good though.",
  "The snare has a better placement in the mix, blending more with the rest of the drum kit. Better pulse that also supports the vocals more.",
  "The vocals stand out quite a bit. The balance between the instruments is okay, but the vocals really hover over everything. Sounds super live.",
  "Lack of low-mid. The guitars lose their body because of this. These guitars almost sound like DI signals, also filtered a bit too much between 2-5kHz? -This mix fills the frequency spectrum better in the low and high compared to the low-mid. -Lots of delay! -Those keys in the chorus are actually a bit loud, but they sound pretty cool.",
  "Balance between instrumental and vocals completely wrong. Vocals far too loud. Spatial balance good though. Nice sense of space",
  "Sounds like i solo'd the vocal reverb track...",
  "Vocals are clearly too loud and the space design used here therefore seems too much too. Although it could be due to everything else being so quiet. The rest of the mix is being severely affected when vocals are in and even if they were mixed well vocals is affecting what we hear a lot negatively",
  "really impressive echo and reverberate effect on this track, but i think it too much",
  "Nice mix, the vocals still feel a bit too dry to me; they could use more space. That way, they would fit better with the spatial sound of the instruments.",
  "A very direct mix. I'd add some effects; I find the vocals too upfront in the mix, especially during the harmonies.",
  "Beautiful balance and stereo image.",
  "With the exception of the vocals, which could be more controlled in their dynamics, the mix sounds very musical and powerful. The reverb on the snare is a bit large/long for the song. It's a pity that more spatial effects aren't used in the choruses (delay on the vocals?). In mono, the mix retains almost its full strength, but it becomes noticeable that the vocals are still somewhat uncontrolled.",
  "Vocals are quite dry in reverb, a lot of high frequencies, energy comes across well.",
  "This mix has a lot of energy for me. Drums (especially snare) might be a bit too loud, making the rest less audible. I miss the little guitar in the chorus; that's quite important. Vocals are too quiet in the beginning. Besides the snare being too loud, the mix is quite well balanced. Vocals are well balanced with each other. Apart from the snare being too loud, I find this mix quite successful. Guitar should be a bit louder in the chorus. This mix is louder and more open than the others.",
  "Drums are much more upfront. Due to this, I pay less attention to the vocals. The vocals being louder in the chorus helps, though.",
  "I'm a fan of this balance. This mix might sound a bit dry; the song sounds quite powerful with some reverb, but overall, it's mixed quite tightly. Perhaps a tad brighter in general.",
  "The vocals lack some effects and are a bit too quiet in the verses compared to the chorus. The song sounds clear, and the proportions are right. The guitars might sound a bit too thin.",
  "-Vocals stand a bit above in the verses. -Drums are sometimes a bit filtered in the low end; the snare loses some impact. -Bass is a bit loud but sounds good (that's something). -In the chorus, the guitars suddenly fall back; they sit better in the verses. It makes the chorus sound somewhat empty. -Overall, a good mix.",
  "We discover things we can't hear on other mixes. Good presence and punchiness. Bass drum a bit too boomy. A bit \"in your face\" but fits well the style. Better use of panning than other mixes. I like the guitar pads on the sides. Vocals should be a bit louder on the verses especially in the quiet parts. Really good chorus. Like the effect on the vocals in the chorus.",
  "Punchy track. Very nice in chorus. Well balanced. Guitars need to be stronger. Drums are tinny. Everything coming from centre apart from spaced guitars, sounds dead at times when guitars get lost.",
  "good, bass bit too much",
  "is like the improved version of 4, with a bit more gain and levels more balanced",
  "Best mix overall. Well balanced",
  "i like this. Clearer voice but not getting over the rest of the tracks",
  "Most visibly the \"heaviest\" mix of all. More prominent kicks but not so visible on the Bass so not a complete EQ on overall mix but on the drums particularly. Vocals could be louder here but otherwise a fair balanced mix",
  "the vocal sound is quite prominent in this soundscape",
  "It sounds very nasal, a bit strange; it could be related to the monitoring method during the mix (earphones, headphones, monitors, ...). In terms of balance, it's nice, but still a bit dry.",
  "The balance is okay, but the guitars and vocals are a bit too much on top of each other. There's a lot happening in the 800-2.5k range.",
  "The mix lacks focus in its balance choices: I don't know where to listen... In the verse, where the vocals are not very intelligible (which doesn't contribute to the emotion and is somewhat frustrating), they are suddenly placed loudly in the chorus. The choice of the snare sound is interesting but is too static to fulfill its role as an anchor. In mono, the mix loses a lot of its strength, and the strange balance choices become more apparent.",
  "Many guitars, strange EQ especially in the midrange, making it sound like it's coming through a radio.",
  "Completely different mix, guitar clearly upfront. Kind of a singer-songwriter approach. The shaker also gives a vibe reminiscent of a 1960s production.",
  "This mix could use a bit more brightness. In my opinion, the drums don't bring enough energy as they are now. It sounds somewhat dry, and I miss some punch in the drums.",
  "The vocals and actually everything is too narrow (EQ). Guitars too loud. Not bad chorus though. Good presence. Panning could be a bit more used to spread things a bit more.",
  "sounds like everything is mixed from just 1 mic (singer's mic)",
  "Attenuated frequencies at low and high end and mix centred around mid frequencies.Low level of excitement. Some grouping seems to happen between guitar and drums as the guitar sound seems to be cancelling the drums in the beginning.",
  "the vocal sound is too vague, and it sounds like lack of some harmonies.",
  "The whole mix sounds very lo-fi, as if it was played over an old telephone or a radio. Otherwise the instruments are relatively well balanced",
  "Guitars are low, nice high end overall. Maybe the best mix, but just because you cannot hear the bad overdriven guitars",
  "Good width with the panning. Too much drums with exaggerated reverb, like it's being played in a stadium. Vocals are too thin. Doesn't sound natural. It's the FM sound.",
  "interesting use of space, bit flat in the front",
  "best mix, everything sounds good in stereo. I can clearly differentiate the different instruments",
  "What I usually achieve by setting the EQ to \"rock\" on a hifi system. Heavy low and high frequencies. The amount of high frequencies are more that I like. Guitar seems stereo. Overall a fair/good mix but would be tiring to listen to more than a few minutes and it lacks too much mid frequencies. This is noticeable towards the end where the keys come in",
  "Vocals a bit too much \"excited\" by some kind of tube-modelling",
  "perfect",
  "Low-pass filtered. Lost of definition. Feels like a highly compressed (in the audio coding sense) version.",
  "This one is also ok but I feel 0 is more balanced",
  "This has a bit more character than the others, perhaps thanks to the guitar",
  "Guitar/bass instruments sound \"fragile\" / dampened and fuzzy. Sounds like listening through a radio",
  "The best of the four mixes, good balance of the drums, good balance between guitars and bass. Lack of vocal presence in the choruses (gain automation in that part).",
  "Very good, guitars with the correct presence and well-distributed; vocals very well equalized and with the appropriate processing, bass and drums very well integrated.",
  "The vocals could be more present. The drums have a good balance, and the keys also fit well in the mix.",
  "Best of the lot. The vocal seems ok. The cymbals need to be less bright. The bass is also not good.",
  "The vocals could be more integrated with the other elements. Good definition of the different riffs in the verse. Good balance between the different instruments. Rain stick too loud. A good mix overall.",
  "Mix lacking brightness overall. The stereo image is a bit confusing in the drums.",
  "Saturation on the vocals suits the genre but could still have a bit more air. Guitar could use a bit more brightness.",
  "Excessive drum presence and excessive use of reverbs. The drum elements sound distant from the musical field, just like the guitars are overly present for this formula. Lack of brightness in guitars and vocals. Excessive midrange in vocals. Lack of gain automation in vocals. Bass is missing.",
  "Reverb too present. The mix loses strength by having too much space.",
  "Excessive treatment of the vocals, creating a strange plasticity. Excessive presence compared to the other elements. We can't hear the other pieces of the drum kit besides the mid-highs from the overheads. Good bass balance. Excessive presence of the pianos.",
  "The time-based effect on the vocals doesn't complement anything. Guitars are not very present. Lack of volume in the drums.",
  "The effect on the vocals is too much. The mix, in general, is too muffled. The vocals are too prominent in the more intense part of the song. The drums are very hidden. It lacks enough strength to carry the song when needed.",
  "Excessive presence of keyboards and vocals. Guitars with a very strident tone. Excess of hi-hats in the chorus. Drum details are not heard with precision (lack of compression and gain boost).",
  "Excessive drums, vocals, and backing vocals (especially in the chorus). Lack of work on the vocals (applying EQ to add more brightness, compressor to give more dynamic presence, and reverb to simulate the room that the original studio lacked). Missing guitars and bass lines.",
  "The mix lacks a bit of strength. Background vocals take up too much space that belongs to the main vocals. The keys with delay add an interesting space.",
  "Excess midrange and the presence of overdriven guitars, perhaps due to the gain or pans excessively leaning to the left. Snare, toms, and kick drum have no presence in the mix, at the same time, there's a certain exaggeration in the presence of hi-hats in the chorus. The mix lacks body, needs EQ and compression on the Final Mix channel.",
  "Quite balanced where the guitars are mixed well, bass too. The snare could have more mid-lows to give it more body.",
  "Good mix, but the vocals needed more attention to not get lost in some parts of the mix.",
  "It has better definition in the guitar, but the rest seems very confusing/muffled.",
  "The spatialization helps the music. However, the processed vocals create something bizarre. The instrumental guitar section lacks body and highs: it becomes too thin...",
  "Worst of the mixes, vocals with excessive effects, I can't even quite describe what it is. The bass seems to be the best within everything.",
  "The volume of the vocals is high in relation to the instrumental, especially in the choruses with effects. The choice of vocal effect makes it distant from the rest of the band and in a different space. Another element that stands out excessively is the tambourine. The mix has a lot of information in the center, causing the guitar and bass lines to sometimes become confusing. Overall, the low-end seems a bit high and the highs low, causing little definition in the sound. All instruments seem to be dynamically controlled without losing their timbre. Overall, if the volumes were better balanced, the entire mix would improve.",
  "The chorus should have compression to avoid so much variation. Chorus and vocals should be less present. And the voice is processed in an unorthodox way. There is a bright percussion instrument too present.",
  "- The base guitar could be higher, as well as the solo - Good drums mix - Vocals too high",
  "In terms of volumes, everything seems fine. The guitars are in tremendous confusion (in the solo, there is a greater perception).",
  "The drums are too muffled, the vocals lack interest. The drums are too loud, and the snare lacks definition.",
  "Compressed drums create a heavier and more stable tone in the music. However, it makes the mix sound more pop, \"which may not be the best solution to differentiate it from other songs.\"",
  "- Drums could be higher (especially the snare drum) - Missing some power to the bass (maybe more volume and a little distortion) - Good guitar mix (base/solo)",
  "Not only the excessive reverb on the vocals, but they also panned the vocals to the L and R, making things even stranger.",
  "The volume between instruments is balanced, with the vocals and solo guitar slightly above the snare. There is a good use of stereo imaging, providing a nice separation between instruments and their various timbres. However, some effects on the vocals make them confusing. It seems that the use of compression/limiting/saturation was exaggerated. This processing caused the drums, especially the snare and cymbals, to lose some characteristics. The use of reverbs and short delays contributes to making the mix larger and more immersive. However, as the mid-low range is too filled, attention is diverted to the bass and snare, making the sound less defined and clear. Overall, less compression and better cleaning of the mid-range would help improve the overall sound.",
  "This mix has greater definition than some. The vocals are very muffled. It is more open than the others in a positive sense.",
  "The voice is very distant when the accompaniment comes in. Compression makes the mix more audible. The percussion is well done.",
  "- Great drums mix - Solo guitar could be higher - Good vocals mix (good use of reverb)",
  "Within the not so pleasant mixes I just heard, this one seemed to be the best. Despite the low volume of the drums, there is a good relationship between the drums and the bass. The vocals need treatment. The guitars need more emphasis.",
  "The volumes between the instruments are unbalanced, especially in the relationship between guitar, vocals, and snare. It has a lot of information in the center, making the mix a bit cluttered and lacking space. Timbrically, the mid-bass area is too filled, making the mix a bit cluttered and unclear. The use of effects, especially on the guitar, made its sound unclear and placed it slightly apart from the rest of the band. Overall, if the effects were improved or reduced, the mix would sound better.",
  "The definition of the vocals is slightly better than the others.",
  "The guitars sound good, and there is a well-balanced volume. However, the vocals sometimes exhibit effects that I didn't like to hear. The guitar solo is quite hidden.",
  "The vocals and guitar are louder than the rest of the instruments. All instruments seem overly processed and equalized, the mix lacks body. Especially the vocals have only high frequencies. The music has little dynamics and is overly compressed. All instruments seem centered, making the mix less interesting and small. Overall, the whole song feels distorted and overly filtered.",
  "The vocals sound even more radio-like, but it's not to my liking at all. Too much indistinctiveness and too many high frequencies. Backing vocals don't fit well with the main vocals. However, the mix of instruments is pleasant. I would like to hear a bit more snare drum.",
  "Missing low frequencies! The overall equalization is really bizarre; there was no openness; however, this mix takes this song in a new direction, very interesting. The vocals are very well done, as well as the drums. The guitar sounds very good.",
  "Among the mixes, this one was my favorite. I think the vocals are better related/balanced with the rest of the instrumentation.",
  "The vocals stand out slightly from the other instruments. Timbrically, the low-end seems a bit exaggerated, and the mid-range is a bit muddled. The use of effects in this mix is the one that works best because it opens up all the instruments in the stereo image without losing their clarity.",
  "The vocals have an interesting definition. I'm not very fond of the back vocals. The rest of the instruments are overly compressed (in terms of sensation). I miss a slightly more prominent snare drum.",
  "Soloist's voice well done (reverb and equalization); the accompaniment of the voice is well done; the chorus could be stronger. The guitar sounds good but could be slightly more prominent. The dirty drums are cool.",
  "- Good final mix (between vocals and the other instruments) - Bass guitar is well balanced, as well as the Guitar - Missing some reverb to the backvocals",
  "Seems very compressed. The voice lacks any life. It sounds like it's compacted.",
  "The volume between instruments is well balanced, with snare and vocals being more prominent. Timbrically, the standout is the poorly defined and muddled snare sound. The vocals also seem to be excessively equalized. However, the distortion used in the vocals works well with this style of music. The reverb and delay effects are moderate and enhance the mix. Overall, the timbre of the mix is not well controlled, lacking definition and brightness.",
  "I don't like the vocals, too thin, too much effort to sound radio-like. The mix of instruments is quite balanced. I like the subtlety of the backing vocals.",
  "Nice panoramic opening; bizarre vocal processing; well-done vocal accompaniment; reasonable chorus. Too much present bass.",
  "- Good final mix (between vocals and the other instruments) - Bass could be powerfull - Guitar could be higher - Vocals too much on the right",
  "Enjoyed the split guitar on L and R. However, I find it too loud in relation to the rest of the instrumentation.",
  "the panoramas don't satisfy me: the accompaniment of the voice shouldn't have been spatialized. The choir could have been stronger. The soloist's voice could have been worked on more.",
  "- Drums could be higher - Guitar too much on the left - Good vocals mix (nice reverb) - Good back vocals mix - Bass could be powerfull",
  "A well-balanced mix, but everything sounds a bit muffled. I like the chorus, though.",
  "The chorus is very well done. Strong bass. The beginning went very well. Lacks presence in the mids: the guitar is too invisible (as is the drum).",
  "- Kick Drum too high (compared to the rest) - Hi Hats too low - Good Guitar and Bass Guitar mix - Good vocals and back vocals mix",
  "Mix is a bit muffled. Keys are too prominent.",
  "Complete lack of low frequencies. Sounds like a low-quality stream. Despite that, in terms of overall balance, it seems interesting. Lack of bass presence. Excessive pianos in the chorus. Needs better work on the vocal lines (reverb and gain automation in the parts leading up to the chorus).",
  "Drums are well present. Mix too strident. Lacks body.",
  "Guitars are too bright, without low end at all, sound to thin. The vocal is quite thin also. The bass is a bit low, needs a bit mor roundness. The drums seem to have a bit too much room when the snare hits.",
  "Excessive presence of the main vocal for this mix, but it shows a good balance in the VOICE group and the INSTRUMENT group. There is a lack of balance application between these two groups.",
  "Voice with too many mids, sounds too muffled. Tambourine too loud. A better balance between guitar and keys during the verse might help for a fuller sound. Snare drum very hidden.",
  "It seems to me that the choice to set the vocals apart was good, but a bit exaggerated. The bass is good, and the guitars too. The drums could have the kick more present.",
  "vocal could use more clarity versus the keys. also, more compression once the chorus hits, her voice sticks out too far. otherwise cool! nice rhythm section. not a big fan of the vocal delay/verb personally.",
  "Like the low end punch, need more pop from the snare.",
  "Weird L&R image, Nice vocals, Could have a bit more low end.",
  "thick - keys, guitar. snare too far back, but balance in general is good.",
  "Besides the guitar and keyboard being panned too far, this mix makes sense, maybe a little less wet sound on the reverb to make it fit with such a dry drum and bass sound, but that is more of a preference.",
  "cool but a bit too much reverb and needs some better dynamic control on the voice. drums and bass are too far down in volume",
  "Great mix, clear and compelling. A little low heavy though.",
  "good",
  "Very reverberant but it's ok, sounds good. Nice balance.",
  "nice vox. ambiance goes well with rhythm instruments. kick covered up by bass. snare not cutting through enough",
  "Generally good. Vocals still get lost bit before the chorus (as with all mixes)",
  "Guitar is too prominent, mix is too trebly",
  "Really good spatial positioning of the delicate effects and synths. Vocals stand strong and clear. Guitars balanced",
  "Spacious, warm mix.",
  "Here we here drums better, but it lacks a bit of overall enveloping or character. Good spread. I like it.",
  "good",
  "Relaxing and enchanting.",
  "clear voice, more shiny overall",
  "balance is good. not too much reverb like other tracks. decent spread of instruments, good balance between sources. maybe a little less on the reverb actually, or perhaps a bit of a LPF on the return of the reverb",
  "Inappropriate reverb. Weird L&R image. No high end.",
  "vox sound good but everything else is a little undefined",
  "Cool vocals but where is the rest of the mix? Sounds like a HPF on the rest.",
  "Sound like I'm in a church - very incongruous reverb.",
  "cool, silky vox. rest of band sounds dark and far back. cooler if it was a bit closer and more intimate.",
  "Nice, guitars are a little muffled though",
  "bright",
  "Muddy, no transients or punch. Vocals stand out nicely.",
  "Guitar loses impact due to compression, but creates a nice subtle mix.",
  "Instrumentals lack impact. Quite a lot of reverb on vocals, but this give the mix warmth.",
  "Good depth of the voice. I noticed the guitar with this mix. It needs more presence of the rhythmic structure. Compared to the others, there are things missing.",
  "I love this track. Effect is great",
  "Soft and warm.",
  "would like it wider. music feels very low, vocal is VERY up front. the rest of the music doesn't",
  "too much rhythm section (especially kick & bass), vocal gets lost sometimes in the verse. missing a supportive vocal verb, but it'd come across better if the vocal were higher / ridden. and i think i hear too much mix bus compression.",
  "Super dull. Weird drums and acoustic and vocal.",
  "drums veiled (more highs), kik a little too forward, snr dark, in general good balance could be brighter - esp vocal to cut",
  "kick drum too hot, and thick - help!",
  "strong kick but the snare is too dark. lead vocals could use more ambience. bg vox cool",
  "punchy but way too boomy and super mid heavy",
  "If you can clean up the low end mud, then this would be a better mix. Kick and snare are really overpowering the song, esp in the chorus.",
  "Good mix overall, just not driving, something cloudy in the low-mids.",
  "vox should be a bit louder. could be more ambiant. drums nice but too much kick in relation to others. bass needs more definition.",
  "Not enough high end in general in the instruments. Sounds muddy, but punchier than Track 8. Bass Guitar too strong.",
  "punch of the snare could be at a higher pitch, overall nice, balanced. vocal is nice. smooth. a bit simple compared to other mix's could have more vibe. probably close to the best, but i would have more reverb on the vocal",
  "Nice balance, guitars have a weir resonance that is conflicting with the organ. Organ is too wide, don't know if it will work in mono. Hated the vocal effect but in the end got used to it, nice one. Guitar player's mix?",
  "good ideas for your mixing, but needs more balanced, guitar it's too loud.",
  "Cool vocal effect effect, but maybe not always. I like the portishead vibe though. Pretty good balance overall",
  "\"interesting\" vocal... but come on, you cannot understand words!",
  "Unappropriate Vocal, Weird balance. Mix doesnt suit the music. Nice kick and bass balance.",
  "Cool vocal sound - would've switched to regular sound on chorus, kik needs definition",
  "The theory of vocal reverb is cool, but it doesn't make sense with the rest of the mix. Also, the guitar and the keyboard are much too loud. They are really taking over the mix. Really the whole mix is imbalanced.",
  "creative mix on the vox, drums sit nice, elec guitar is a little too present",
  "cool effect on the vocals for a special use, but not the full song. Guitar is distorting and sounds like a plastic box (super midtastic)...not a good thing. the rest is very thin",
  "Interesting vocal sound and cool blend with the band.",
  "vocals too soft and muffled. But I like the delay effect.",
  "Odd phasing pulling everything right. Not balanced. Mix is nice otherwise, especially in the chorus. Vocal needs to be louder when using effects.",
  "Interesting personality. A bit violent filtering. It could be better. It's like another song, though.",
  "I love this song ,but not this track, it is electronical and anamorphic.",
  "Less mid frequency but vocals could be dealt like this in some cases.",
  "the effect on the vocal is nice. would have fit better with more seperation of the other sources. its a nice idea but could have been executed better. the right channel has the loud guitar which become annoying after a wile",
  "Dry mix, no depth. Vocal is too loud, the rest is pretty good. Where is the reverb? Come on, a bit won't hurt anyone. Oh god, the vocal needs it!",
  "like the fullness of the mix. vocals could come up a hair, and with a different EQ & a bit of verb support it'd take 1st.",
  "Overall, a good balance.",
  "not a good drum mix & sounds (weird snare). ld vocal needs better context (with verb or something) and better rides",
  "Guitar too loud. Drums could use some punch. Might have been nice to have a touch of verb on the vocal. Balances pretty OK.",
  "Ok mix but clarity isn't quite there. can't hear the drums well and lose the voice in the bass build up at chorus",
  "Nice. Vocals too dry. Drums too dry.",
  "Too much guitar, it dominates the vocal",
  "Prefer these stronger guitars than Track 1. However some energy lacking, odd periods of overly dry mix. Vocals stand out nicely, but too dry in the Chorus.",
  "Sounds like there is some noise in the background with the groove.",
  "Vocales don't cut through the instrumentation, while the mix is reasonably clear.",
  "voice sound like not match the melody",
  "dry, decent. a little boxy but not too bad. not too wide. a bit boring but better than extremes of others. sounds quite under mixed. a bit too aggressive on acoustic guitar in verse. could have been dipped more.",
  "vocal is front and center, which is good. the tom sticks out. other instruments (besides the tom) could come up some to support the vocal & add some sauce.",
  "top drums too light; kick too loud for bass level / sound. vocal verb not in perspective.",
  "everything sits pretty nicely, the bass is a little too trebley",
  "Drums almost sound good. Too much kick not enough snare. Guitar too far back. At least you're not wrecking it.",
  "Not enough low end, bass need a bit of a boost. A little bright overall as well, but all of the timbres are nice.",
  "nice vox, ambiant and dark, but everything around her sounds too dark. too much \"poof\" in kick. not enough \"crack\" in snare.",
  "Nice width to the mix",
  "bright vocal",
  "Nice mixing for this type of song.",
  "Vocals very prominent. Punchy drums. Guitar too quiet. Lacks subtlety.",
  "Drums have good punch.",
  "I like the effect of the voice. It makes it more present in the memory. But maybe it stands out too much.",
  "Quite nice all-round except the guitar is distorted. Probably not intentional?",
  "vocal boxy, reverb decent, spread is alright. very scooped, could do with a bit more body.",
  "vocals & drums are super quiet in verses - just too much strings & keys i think. otherwise good!",
  "The mix is pretty mono.",
  "First mix I've heard with a snare drum in it. Thank you. Could use a little more punch from the kick/bass. Kind of muddy down there. Vox is a little low too.",
  "main vox too far back in mix, maybe a touch too much verb but verb is nice",
  "Like the vocal delay, drums not quite as present as #5, bass a little murky",
  "flat sounding drums, good vocal level",
  "it could be a cool \"thin\" effect for about 5 seconds, but when lacks body in everything so just sounds thin.",
  "cool vox ambiance. could be louder. drums could be a bit louder.",
  "Too bassy, not enough vocals, guitars too prominent",
  "Really like the strong guitars, however they are spread out during the chorus, becomes a bit messy. Vocals lost in verse. Drums not strong enough, but like the clean nature.",
  "good and common",
  "trop de vocal verb & kinda weak muffled drums. but i like the idea of the mix.",
  "Muddy and too wet. Vocal sounds nice but I need more presence/punch from ryhtm section",
  "Unappropriate reverb on Vocal, Balance could be better.",
  "ok",
  "Dude, where am I? Way too spaced out and sounds like a room mic in a club and that's it. not good",
  "Too much vocal fx, interesting, but gets boring and old. great mix otherwise. great backing vocals.",
  "Too much verb on vocal, low end is nice, everything is nice but vocal verb is swamping everything else.",
  "nice and dark. vox too wet. cool effect but needs to be controlled. drums not loud enough. rhythm guitar sticks out in left field.",
  "huge reverb is appropriate. vocals need more presence. something weird with the guitar (too dry?)",
  "Sounds like it was recorded in a cathedral",
  "I quite like the idea of the distant reverb. However, there could be more dry lead vocals in the mix to maximise their impact.",
  "Reverb makes the track more 'complete' and coherent. Good mix with backing vocals.",
  "sounds like singing happening in a big closed room.",
  "Beautiful.",
  "distortion in the ... left channel is quite distracting. reverb is nice. on the right its very distracting. openness is nice. wait, too much reverb. the more i listen to it, the wilder it sounds. the instrument on the left is really quite distracting and it sounds unbalanced. too much reverb, especially on the chorus",
  "Nice balance. Lacking a bit of lows. \"Mid-Rangy\"",
  "voice is too dry, although it sits nice in the mix - chorus doesn't hit hard enough, no forward motion",
  "strange phase treatment on guitar in verse. voc dry?? bass light and kick as well.",
  "Snare out of phase with OH's? LD V and LD V answers too loud, need perspectiveEPno out of phase L to R",
  "Vox a little too hot on verse. Nice chorus though.",
  "lack of depth compared to others, leading voice very in front. Maybe some reverb would have made it slightly more interesting.",
  "good mix",
  "The singer' s voice is a bit uncomfortable during the high pitch area. May be it should be stronger compress. But the speak aside is wonderful.",
  "Sometimes the snare pops out. Vocal sound is nice",
  "a little dry. not enough low end.",
  "Drums have too much compression - voice is a little boring, maybe too compressed - Good balance",
  "guitars a bit under in chorus. voc thin and dry? drums narrow but good sound. bass light? good mix",
  "Verse has interesting Track / Drums, but too narrow, no lows, no OH's; not enough EGtr in V's. LD V balances not consistent. in V's EGtr too soft / LD V too loud in C's the opposite",
  "Verse OK. Pretty mono. Drums could have a much better EQ. Guitars take over the whole mix. Something needs to be brighter.",
  "Vocal a little quiet but good otherwise.",
  "Vocals a bit too far back in the mix. good presence on bass",
  "Very well balanced mix.",
  "This seems to me well balanced",
  "The singer's voice is kind of stuffy, warm and wet. The instruments is the secondary but supersedes the primary (vocality).",
  "I like that this mix is really different from the other ones. Vocals are too loud. Bass is there but feels distant.I rated it high because it is interesting, not because it's good",
  "Definitely too quiet, the guitar and the hi hat are muffled. Nice space on the vocals",
  "Vocals too loud and reverb obvious. Detracts from any good mixing practices that might be there",
  "Nice reverb. It makes the voice stand out. Good balance of the rest. The voice captures the attention. I like this one.",
  "Strong sense of presence",
  "the sense of space is too strong.",
  "Clearly, and gentle singer voice. It really make the whole track medium. Such track comforts the listeners' heart. In terms of the whole track, there is no outstanding part.",
  "nice snare compression! sounds good until it gets loud... then the bottom drops out and it's too squashed.",
  "Good. When the guitars come in needs more punch/blend. Like the vox!",
  "nice verb. like the active panning on the BGs. compression on the drums is the right idea, but overdone.",
  "very bright vocals and guitars in the chours, maybe too much",
  "bright... good drums, bass. voc too bright for me, guitars too much 400Hz in chorus",
  "would prefer if the vocals were a bit more prominent than the other instruments",
  "Sounds bright and punchy",
  "Strong balance, but vocal weak in verse. quite bright... - MID MID MID in the chorus - especially with the distortion - that needs tidied up!",
  "its better than 1 in terms of the voice",
  "too much panning to L channel, loud guitar",
  "The chorus in track 6 is excellent mixed. Not only the vocal but also the instruments are matched fairly good.",
  "good chorus, verse is a little lackluster",
  "Very smooth sounding. I like it!",
  "Great. drums a little dark but good balance overall and good change at the chorus.",
  "Nice power on the Chorus. Overall balance is nice.",
  "voc too hot at the top, better in chorus. snare pulling to the left?? also too dark snare too compressed (guitars esp).",
  "Where is the snare? Can't hear it at all. Voice distorting and I doesn't sound intentional. Horrible balances.",
  "A bit too quiet. The backing vocals are too loud (very close to the main vocals).",
  "like the proximity of the vocals",
  "strong projection of voice (maybe a bit too much but I like it), good balance, relaxing. Maybe drums and bass could be better.",
  "Chorus mix is good, verse is a bit lacking. Nice space/rev",
  "Good mix, the panning for the two voices in the 1st part is better in other tracks, but the mix isn't bad. On the 2nd part, at the end, some more reverb in the voice would have been nice.",
  "good mix",
  "Nice balance, the only problem I hear is that the background vocal pops out too much. The chorus is a little cluttered balance wise.",
  "smooth mix. \"i'm scared to go\" too much in my face. tied for best.",
  "Interesting verb on vocals. The \"response\" vocals split your head in half a bit",
  "verse is pretty good. not sure about the phase effects. snare needs to cut way more in the chorus.",
  "BG vox is distracting, keys are nice in the mix during chorus, lead vox lacks some punch",
  "again strange backgrounds in verse. good drums and bass in verse, guitars take over too much in chorus. Voc too strong on right in chorus - unbalanced. strange phase on rhyth guitar in verse?",
  "very creative, but unconvincing LD V answers too loud and out of phase",
  "too much organ. Nothing has definition. Harsh mix. Too much compression.",
  "Vocal too quiet. Are backing vocals out of phase? Phase issues?",
  "backing vocals could be improved",
  "nice mix, prominent keyboard and vocals, mid-low frequencies a bit loud, could have less reverb",
  "Good use of reverb for the second part. Guitar in the first part should be louder. And the rhythm guitar in the 2nd part sounds muddy, maybe the eq is not correct.",
  "Not bad. If the vocality is more clear, it would be better.",
  "Backing vocals scare the shit out of you, general balance is mediocre (sorry)",
  "out of phase backing vocals???? too compressed",
  "backgrounds wierd - phasey, too loud. drums good guitars too loud dwarfing drums in chorus",
  "Nice bass, but there are pumping and phase issues throughout...",
  "Too much midrange, cannot hear the low frequencies.",
  "backing vocals coming out unbalanced",
  "Like the guitar stabs sound as they have far more presence. Vocals good and panning more obvious",
  "backing vocals very dominant, a bit flat compared to others. Filtered?",
  "I like this one but the second voice now stands a bit too much",
  "Choir too loud, it sounds like on/off, no transitions, too abrupt.",
  "the deputy is too strong.",
  "Balanced, powerful, just fantastic!",
  "pretty good! second vox a bit distracting. like the picky guitar presence (though a bit less would be good) & transition to chorus. vox sound a bit thin in chorus. nice and loud... best.",
  "Overall pretty good! needs more punch maybe? Verby!",
  "Nice! Like the use the depth in the verse and the appropriate change at the chorus. compression is just right. low end is good. upper midrange a little harsh at times but this is the best overall.",
  "good balance, open",
  "Nice balance. Good vocals",
  "Lacks bass - Voice sounds nice and full,good use of voice double - stereo image creates interest",
  "good drums and bass, voc good. buss compression on the chorus too much? good balances. good voc reverb",
  "good balances; consistent mix persepectives",
  "Finally a good sounding verse. Drums a bit thin but ok. Vocal needs riding. Overall decent mix.",
  "Sounds like a record!! Really like this one.",
  "Drums too loud. The clean guitar has turned to slightly overdriven here.",
  "i think this track is balanced well",
  "like the backing vocals",
  "Good balance on mix and maybe could do with a little more high frequency content on guitars but not much",
  "not bad, not much to say. It seems fair. Maybe too much of mid-low frequencies, it results in a sense of 'being closed' compared to the uncertain presence of the leading voice.",
  "Nice balance, nice space, good dynamics, but bass is a little strong.",
  "Really like this mix. Well balanced.",
  "nice and balanced mix",
  "Now guitar in the 1st part is too loud. However the mix is better for the whole song.",
  "i think this mix is better.",
  "This mix is wonderful.",
  "Clear vocals, but lacking space. snaps panning a little weird. general clear. Toms forward.",
  "Vocal is bizzarely filtered sounding - no highs, too much mids; good vox level vs ensemble though; nice hard panning on snaps - though too loud and present - dominates vox; nice snare drum sound; bold panning ++ but faliure to compensate for it with appropriate levels and EQ -- meager amt of bass freq",
  "Super Dry",
  "good balance kick bass. overall could be more reverb. good balance",
  "too dry; clicks panned too far left, not enough ambience; bad comp on e piano",
  "good sounds, whoa fingersnaps! and dry",
  "vocals sound wierd and super dry. reverb problem?",
  "3rd: Panning sounds interesting, toms unreasonably loud. Vocals are cutting well through the mix without being too loud. The finger snaps to one side stand out a bit too much (not in loudness but position). Better than (McG-H)",
  "Great percussive levels and eq, and balanced wide panning. B.vox pan to one side and lacking beef. Dry vox",
  "better 3D perception, but maybe too much...",
  "good but dry",
  "too dry and sharp and aggressive sound, it seems like radio. Nice organ/synth.",
  "Track 4 is not interesting. It sounds like the singer have experienced many vicissitudes of life, and timbre is kind of weak. So stronger instruments sound is needed to support the singers voice, especially multiple instruments are played. If it is a personal concert only with one Folk Guitar, this kind of show way can be concerned.",
  "Most reverb on the vocals thus far, but I like it. Drums too roomy though, and buried. Can't hear the keys at all.",
  "I really like the acoustical space they are prestened in. Vocal and the instrument quality seems to be lot better in this mix.",
  "9th: The overall timbre is too nasal. Vocal a too loud for me (overbearing really), though it is well presented. There is little contrast between first and second part, second part is overall too loud. The reverb is overbearing. Some cool stuff with the dynamics but it doesn't save the overall feeling",
  "What happened? Clear artefacts from compression, vocals and finger clicks way too loud and in the face, music is not existing and also it lacks the bottom end.",
  "Very thin, vocals too prominent",
  "Vocal overload. Instruments just lost into this reverb soup! Vocals are not too bad and the second half is nice but unconstructed without some tracks.",
  "Maybe a bit too much top end EQ on the mix. Reverb very apparent, especially on the finger snaps.",
  "Less natural than track 2. Good beginning, however, the last part should reinforced by turn up the volume of the ultimate instrument.",
  "The initial melodic instrument is too prominent. The voice is too strong, but relatively well balanced with the choir. The reverb on the claps is on the right path, just too much attack.",
  "cymbals could be brighter and closer; tubby bass; accordian is as important as vocal? nuh uh",
  "Wide panning. Can hear Rhodes very well. clear vocals. big bass. Big space. strumming guitar apparent.",
  "Depth in the vocal, clear drum sound in the center, overall balance and image are good.",
  "this sounds good. all the parts shine through and have their own place in mix; tasty reverb.",
  "Bass a bit too heavy and muddy. Nice balance, otherwise.",
  "Best balance. Nice low end. All instruments present. Great vocal sound. Nice verb choice and placed well with the boack up vox. My favourite by far.",
  "good organ; a bit thin on the vox",
  "Sounds pro and well mixed.",
  "reall nice. full of body.vocals sound great, could be a touch louder.",
  "4th: Great balance. Vocals with a touch of reverb that is too much. Stuff gets muddy on the low end, while trying the compromise between roundness and confusion. Good mix technically, but does not fit the song, and the timbre of certain elements is not appropriate.",
  "Nice one.",
  "a bit of proximity but i'm ok with it",
  "First half is very well controlled. The vocals could be a little louder. Some master compression killing the volumes at time as well. Wonderful use of reverb to generate space in the second half.",
  "Instrumentals have good impact.",
  "I like it. Dreamy accordion. Nice to hear some organ/piano. A bit confused/muddy, instruments not well separated.",
  "Very well balanced.",
  "All these instruments match very well.",
  "Good mix, but there is an excess in the gains of the bass lines. Interesting more pronounced presence of the keys and acoustic guitars. Good use of panning (accordion - left / piano - right). Lack of reverb on backing vocals.",
  "Good balance between the male and female vocals.",
  "Good Mix. probably has a bit too much bass. Good back vocals. Nice accordion.",
  "Bass becomes too prominent at times. Main vocals too distant.",
  "In addition to the apparent good equalization, I liked the distribution of instruments across the channels. For example, the accordion on the left side.",
  "The whole mix is quite balanced in terms of volumes, tonally, and spatially. It just seems to me that the mid-range could be more refined and clean.",
  "Slightly too much bass. The beginning fails because the instrumental shouldn't have been so prominent. The vocalist shouldn't be as present. The panning at certain points is too wide, unbalancing the mix. However, the reverb on the vocals is nice.",
  "- Drums could be higher - Vocals are well mixed, maybe could use a little reverb - Bass a little too powefull - Strings too high",
  "Muddy bass. Very bright guitars, strumming is very apparent. Vocals uneven. phasing, evident especially in cymbals.",
  "Nice guitar sound, very spread. Backing vox a bit loud. Main vox are buried a little...",
  "bg vocals, acou guit too loud; drums sound like toys; too much buss comp; voc needs better/more comp",
  "instruments sound good. Big problem with backing vocals and lead vocal balance. Otherwise lacking a bit of body.",
  "The back vocal doesnt sound like back vocal, they pretty much at the same level os the main vocal.",
  "Nice tight mix, vocals slightly too quiet",
  "Lacks some high EQ on the vocals. Can hear acoustic guitar panning which is good",
  "can hear reverb, lively also because of the backing vocals but unbalanced, too resounding of specific frequencies",
  "Harmony too prominent",
  "Excellent. The guitar is clear.",
  "less snaps. please",
  "Bass a little forward, different space than vocals. quite clear.",
  "Vox too quiet. drums sound swag but are too loud; good amount of bass freqencies (bgtr & kik); reasonable person's panning of the 2&4 gtr ++; sounds like a record. too much sub bass.",
  "Nice tight bass. Good balance",
  "nice bass, tight drums.",
  "ok mix; ok drums; clicks little too dry and loud",
  "Great dynamic mix. The groove really comes alive in this mix.",
  "good low end, good balance, good vocal",
  "Mix is good, sounds a bit flat EQ whise. Pan is ok",
  "Nice mix but lead vocal is really limp and lost. feels like it is from another song",
  "best: Impactful and well balanced. Vocals are just a touch buried in the first half. Fits with the song.",
  "generally good",
  "Nice driving bass.",
  "Vocals can be a little too quiet and therefore sound sometimes a little thin! In the second half the clicks are far too loud for the quiet vocals. Needs better balancing and automation use. Instrumentation at the start is nice.",
  "Very warm, subtle mix.",
  "Would like to hear the backing vocals a bit more",
  "pretty balanced",
  "Best of all, although I would have liked to hear a little of reverb in the female voice in the first part. The drums are maybe too present.",
  "The sense of space is not bad. The right or left sound track is mixed in a wonderful method.",
  "good balance",
  "vocal, drums dominates the mix too much. Panning is wide but lack of details and clarity.",
  "Vocal reverb too long, needs some de-essing. The whole track has too much reverb. Pretty good balance in terms of level and frequency, though.",
  "Good balance. Fairly centred in the middle. A little dry perhaps?",
  "bright vox; somewhat hollow",
  "too roomy, but good otherwise",
  "Vocals and balance of lead backing is quite nice. Lacks body though",
  "2nd: Quite nice balance and positioning. The vocals are quite clear and well placed, treated differently for the first part and second which shows some thoughtfulness, though I'm not as fond of the way they sit over the second part.",
  "Great.",
  "good",
  "sounds ok",
  "Starts quite nice and punchy. Vocals are well balanced and lots of energy. Some volume drops, needs a better master compressor. Second half however the vocals feel quite dead.",
  "Levels are good, prominent vocals.",
  "Plain in general, but not bad. Like the eq for the lead voice. Gives more of a live sensation, still track 8 is better.",
  "Sounds harmonious.",
  "i think the hierarchy is good and all instruments are clear.",
  "The feeling of layers is perfect. The last beats and cantos are very good. The occured time of accordion is excellent. The transition of the different instruments are naturally.",
  "Good mix, well-defined balance of bass, midrange, and treble. Good presence of bass lines without compromising the other elements. Excellent dynamics in vocals and backing vocals. I can perceive all elements of the mix. Excellent work on the panning of strings and panoramic automation of the accordion.",
  "At times, the vocals stand out from the mix, becoming more prominent and deviating from the space created for the drums with reverb.",
  "Too much reverb on drums. I think they should have a bit more definition. Acoustic guitar seems a bit thin. Vocal should be a bit louder. Bass seem ok. And keys as well.",
  "This mix seems very well balanced, at appropriate volume levels and tonally correct. However, it seems like a high-pass filter was applied because the low-frequency range is very low.",
  "Very balanced mix. I like the treatment of the vocals. It suits the style of music well.",
  "- Good Drums mix - Guitars and Strings too high - Vocals also extremely high - Good bass presence",
  "more reverb; less accordian, more vocal; cymbals could be brighter and closer",
  "Muddy comparatively, lacking clarity, lots of low mids. vocals uneven",
  "drums could use more room. nice bass but could used more. vox a bit soft",
  "drums too dark; lead voc needs more comp or better rides; clicks too far back for the ambience",
  "smiley face mix (inverse bose)",
  "Pretty good.",
  "Mix is good. eq is flat, spectral balance is ok.",
  "nice balance... drums sound a bit cardboardy, fingersnaps all but disappear. vocals are super flat",
  "sounds rich.",
  "Very dull and lifeless in the second half. Starts off OK, but drums completely dry and unprocessed. Feels like a balance mix.",
  "Kind of slow-rolling. Comfortable.",
  "vocal could be closer/ brighter; nice organ; cymbals could be closer",
  "Drums too comressed for my personal taste, especially the snare. You can really hear it on the pop. Good balacing",
  "somewhat bland, but not bad; I like the organ!",
  "feels super flat. Low end is nice.",
  "good balance between instruments",
  "6th: confusing, stuff is piling up all over the place and instruments trample each other. The electric piano is too loud for the dulness of the sound. The second half is pretty. After the example A it sounds dull, but everything would. Too much compression on the drums, and everything pumps. I understand panning was done for clarity, but I object to the perspective that was created, it does not flatter the syncopation between guitars and keys.",
  "Starts off very strong. Keyboard level nice and gets through. Drums well mixed and balanced. Vocals strong. In second half need some mastering techniques to keep the energy up.",
  "All tracks seem clear on this mix although acoustic guitar could do with a slight boost. Can hear panning.",
  "not bad, correct",
  "The eq is not quite right, maybe lots of mids. There are dynamic jumps too. Not too bad in the end. Some instruments sound 'muddy'",
  "the voice is less prominent and lacks sense of space.",
  "The beginning mix of the instruments are fantastic.",
  "Electric piano very prominent, and acoustic guitar on the left side unbalances the mix.",
  "The voice could be slightly louder. Good balance between instruments that allows a clear perception of each one. The reverb on finger snaps is too pronounced.",
  "Very muffled, low range very prominent.",
  "The vocals are slightly high, as well as the acoustic guitar. The drums are not very present and sound clipped. Overall, the mix is very muddled with a subdued mid-bass. With a better use of stereo image, the definition and clarity of each instrument could improve.",
  "Electric guitar loses some brightness. Vocals also lack prominence and brightness.",
  "- Good final mix - Vocals too high (but good use of reverb) - Drums could be higher - Great mix of the bass",
  "Good mix, excessive presence of attack cymbals from the overheads in certain parts, lack of gain control and reverb automation on the main vocals in the pre-chorus, good presence of the accordion, excessive mids and bass in the rhythm guitars (also missing the use of pans to make the sound more fluid and light).",
  "Needs a bit more main vocal. Overall good balance. Good Mix.",
  "Although the volumes seem fine, I don't feel interaction between the voice and the instrumental.",
  "The initial melodic instrument is too prominent. The creative reverberation doesn't fit.",
  "- Vocals too high, and too much reverb on the vocals - Good Strings mix - Could have more bass (like the track 2)",
  "A cleaner control of the cymbal bleeding would help improve the vocals. The voice does not have the necessary prominence during the verses.",
  "The voice is louder than all instruments, and the entire mix is too midrange and bass-heavy, lacking brightness and definition. In addition, the stereo image was underutilized, making the mix too monophonic.",
  "Balanced mix except for the accordion. A bit muffled, though. It would need a better balance between the accordion and the rest of the instruments.",
  "Too much bass. The vocals were processed very well, nicely accompanied by the female choir.",
  "- Great final mix - Good bass mix - Everything is well balanced, but some instruments are too centered - Great reverb on the vocals",
  "Kick too prominent. Acoustic guitar could be a bit more subtle.",
  "The drums reverberate in a non-natural way to my ears initially. Later on, the mix is generally nice. The claps are well placed.",
  "- Vocals too high (compared to the rest) - Good Drums and Guitar mixes - Strings too hight - Missing some reverb to the vocals - Good bass mix",
  "Overheads a bit high; vocals with excessive reverb. Backing vocals could be more separated from the main vocals.",
  "A more prominent acoustic guitar would help add brightness to the mix.",
  "Voices with too much reverb, especially the secondary. Acoustic guitar could be more present. The entrances and exits of the cymbals are heard in the vocal track in the second part of the song. Some bass frequencies become too prominent.",
  "For example, the relationship between the bass and the drums is good, however, I think they end up making the vocals seem disconnected from the rest of the instrumental context.",
  "I like the treatment of the vocals, along with the backing vocals. The drums are a bit muffled. Perhaps it would need a bit more body.",
  "- Vocals too high and too much reverb on them - Great Strings and Guitar mixes - Drums could be higher - Too much Bass",
  "Excessive reverb and gain that pushes the vocals 'out of the music,' balanced bass lines, good presence of backing vocals, lack of presence of accordions and pianos, excessive presence of the drums in general (especially toms, snare, and kick), lack of overhead presence in parts with fewer elements.",
  "Good positioning of the vocals and stereo image.",
  "The vocal seems ok, should have a bit less reverb. The drums seem a bit boxed up. Acoustic guitar seems fine. Bass is a bit high in the mix.Back vocals are ok.",
  "Good balance between different elements. Mix neither too sharp nor too heavy. Vocals could be slightly louder at times. Perhaps a bit less reverb on the vocals wouldn't be bad.",
  "The snare and vocals are a bit loud; however, the mix is very well balanced. Overall, it just seems to me that the midrange is too predominant.",
  "Interesting mix, but the drums seem to stand out a bit in some moments.",
  "Bass slightly too prominent. The reverb on the vocals is exaggerated. Otherwise, there is a very good balance and overall spatialization. The hand-clap percussion is well placed.",
  "- Great Drums and Vocals mixes - Good Guitars and Bass mixes - Strings too much on the right - Good reverb on Vocals",
  "Yeah! Low end on the bass is too much, makes it feel too loud. I like the balance overall. Fix the bass and collect your Grammy",
  "pretty good, just the vocal needs more automation",
  "use a better vocal verb. otherwise cool.",
  "Nice! A little beefy in the low mids, maybe too much, also a little long on the verb",
  "ok low end, vocal could be a bit brighter",
  "snare too far back. voc a little thick., nice org presentation",
  "sounds good",
  "vocal could be a little brighter",
  "reverb too much/wrong. vocal spread is neat, but evertyhing sounds separated",
  "Too much low end. Clouding what could otherwise be an OK mix.",
  "Vocals a little low-mid heavy. Good bass, but too much maybe.",
  "not bad",
  "Too much low end on bass guitar. Vocal reverb is too long for my taste, and too bright. Stereo image is nice and wide. A little dark over all.",
  "Clear room for the kick and bass to be heard independantly, but still work together. Rhodes louder. Reverb on the rhythm section stuff less, but I like what it's doing for the vocal. I would like the reverb brighter. Some more presence in the lead vocal would be nice - especially the BG vocals louder and more present.",
  "good one, not very bright.",
  "Nicely balanced",
  "ok",
  "Very similar to track 0 but a little more life, some more dynamics. Vocals far too quiet, cannot hear some lyrics",
  "Believe this may be over compressed. Not feeling a full dynamic range is present.",
  "Nice organ. Nice bass. Also the vocals are well arranged with the rest. Groovy. Good also when listening at high volume. A bit muffled on lows.",
  "Wet, rich, balanced in all aspects.",
  "Nice natural sounding snare, could be a touch louder. Kick and bass guitar mixed well, mix has a strong bottom end; Perhaps could use a touch of high-pass at mastering",
  "Sounds good but the EQ needs to be much improved.",
  "sound in the left side is strengthened",
  "Very bright, the balance on the drum kit isn't right.",
  "no low end, too bright, too much reverb",
  "Super bright, no power, no lows.",
  "nice balance, verb jumps out too much occasionally on organ and vox, lacks a bit of bass",
  "the verb decay is a little distracting but otherwise it sits evrything comes through well",
  "Too bright overall, there's no lows... Nice organ level. Too much verb overall, this is funk..... Nice back vocals.",
  "These verbs are really odd, and then why is the voice so dry in comparison. Drums sound really anemic - too much super high end and not enough punch.",
  "Interesting vocal spread? Cool instrumental positioning. Too much reverb on right guitar?",
  "good drums",
  "Rhodes keys too soft in soloing lick. Strange dark hall-like reverb on guitar and keys with a delay on it?? Nice BG vox reverb and balance the double. Good level of bass. Snare needs more snap and high end. Nice kick punchiness.",
  "Too bright and thin hi hat",
  "Nice and wide and balanced",
  "Goldilocks zone of track 1 and 3, not too bright not too dark. Wonderful balance, good energy and lovely space. All the little synth/keys are individually placed. Foot tapping along!",
  "Not much bass cutting thought on this track.Nice panning of instruments",
  "Too much reverb. Nice groove. Too much bass (maybe it's the room).",
  "rhythm instruments too panned and too much reverb, nice space and live feel",
  "same like track7\uff0cbut all instruments sounds listen more close to me",
  "Mid-heavy mix, not unpleasant. Snare needs to pop more. Nicely balanced reverb. A touch of high-end lift at mastering would improve the overall sound.",
  "Rhythm sensation is strong but BGM sounds a little segregate.",
  "excellent and the vocal is dominant and can be separated from the sound of the musical instrument,compare to track1 , in left side, some sound seem to be strengthened.",
  "Consistent mix but has an excess of highs and the presence of hi-hats and overheads in the drums. Excessive processing on the same parts. Backing vocals overly present in the chorus. Good work on the panoramas of pianos vs guitars. Consistent and correctly balanced bass.",
  "The reverb on the vocals seems to be a bit late. Probably should have be less reverb on keyboards. Needs a bit more punch on the drums. Good back vocals.",
  "Good openness and clarity of elements but lacks a bit of strength in the bass. Guitar with too much reverb.",
  "The vocals are too high, and the entire mix lacks body and brightness. However, the subtle reverbs give it more dynamics.",
  "I would reduce some of the reverb on the vocals and some instruments. Backing vocals seem to have more definition than the main vocals. In the chorus, they are definitely louder.",
  "Interesting reverb; well-achieved chorus; interesting panoramas.",
  "nice tight mix. don't love the snare or hats yet & toms don't come out enough. this one is definitely mine, lol.. shoulda used a bit of vocal verb support & a slightly thicker EQ.",
  "Low mid pile up. Cool effect on the pimp lyric.",
  "good punch, maybe too dry",
  "clear, well defined, bass lacks presence/boomy, good balance, vocals mid range-ie",
  "dark thick esp. bass, but voc is bright?? big wide org",
  "has the bass groove, very much needed in a funk song. It's a little too dry for my taste, but the vocal panning gets creative and keeps my interest.",
  "Pretty good, would want a little more snap on the snare. I like the stereo vocal effect. Organs need to be brighter/more aggressive. Good levels overall. More back vocals, they are important in this tune!",
  "Level balance and auible spread is good but too much resonant build up prevents it from being ranked higher. Needs some DeEssing.",
  "Very clean, great vocal sound but boring?",
  "nice",
  "Finally some louder Rhodes. Phased out electric guitar is an interesting effect... but I prefer the image to be more discrete. Same thing with the organ image. Snare it a little soft. Vocal is a little dry. Interesting effects on the vocal - cool. Kick would benefit from body - I'm not feeling the punch.",
  "good but bass a bit too high",
  "Not exceptional, but has a better balance than the others",
  "Love the balance, nice throughout. However too dry in places which kills the energy especially in the beginning.",
  "Strong bass guitar presence",
  "Very spacious, warm mix.",
  "highlight bass\uff0c",
  "Good. well balanced sound",
  "Mix balance is generally good but could use a bit more in the bottom end from the kick and bass guitar.",
  "Sounds not bad but a bit tiring.",
  "drum and some sound seem to increased in right side.the pitch is roughly the same as vocal",
  "Good mix, but it presents an exaggeration in the gains of the bass. Good swing and pans of guitars and pianos. The dishes and hi hats are a little more lacking.",
  "Too much bass. Vocals could be a bit higher. Nice keyboard.",
  "The mix is good, however, I would like to see a better relationship between the guitar and the keys. Perhaps panning would make it better.",
  "This mix is well-balanced in terms of volumes; however, it lacks brightness and any kind of depth or space.",
  "Like it. Seems quite balanced and has brightness in the instruments. I don't like the panning on the vocals. The voice occasionally seems muffled by the other instruments.",
  "Bass slightly strong; the overall balance should be more worked on: the choir doesn't stand out.",
  "- Bass too high - Nice keyboard mix - Good drums mix",
  "Very nice balance, the hats almost want to rape my ears but not quite. Background vocals are too loud. Pretty good!",
  "background vocals are TOO LOUD. but nice.",
  "Really good! Good balance.",
  "Nice. BG vox are too hot, hammond is a little low in the Verse, but overal good",
  "too loud backing vocals",
  "OK balance, Backs too loud, A bit on the dry side. No punch on drums",
  "snare doesnt speak (too dry) and is too dark. bass is good, and kick bg vox too hot, one lead double sticks out on the R",
  "sounds good",
  "weak energy and flat. needs better vocal control. way too much \"fun stuff\" going on with the vocals. They should be leveled and balanced first!",
  "Best vocal sound between all of them, great automation to bring out stuff.",
  "nice",
  "Lead vocal too soft compared to the BGs. kick too soft. Great level for hi-hat. Feels thin in the mid-lows. More bass and kick.",
  "backing vox way too loud",
  "Backing vocals are too loud.",
  "ok",
  "Good backing vocals",
  "Nice, subtle mix.",

  "highlight vocal accompaniment\uff0c",
  "vocal sounds are strong. specially chorus",
  "Decently tight-sounding instrument mix, lacking in bottom end perhaps, could be a tad brighter in the drumkit (snare and overheads particularly). Vox and BV far too loud.",
  "the vocal sound like in the left and right side and create a stereo effect.the harmony is louder compared to the former,",
  "Good.",
  "Nice! Seems a little dark, but great mix. Punchy and stylistically appropriate.",
  "snare is very dark, bit muddy, kik and snare well balanced together (though muddy a bit)",
  "guitar in C doesnt work for me. good org spread but needs shaping. voc is well done",
  "bass growls nicely, but at times it cuts alittle to much. could use some brightness on vox",
  "The mix is a bit mono. Drums vocal bass good level, but need more support from others. Too much buss compression, let it get big!!! \"Small\" sounding mix, maybe a bit too dry.",
  "Sounds like a coffee can with boomy bottom end. (too much low-low mid resonance and need better sculpting on the high mids). better balancing required.",
  "This mix kind of sounds like steely dan. Kick needs more deffinition.",
  "Great low end and managing of the groove. Very clean mix.",
  "good mix but a bit dry",
  "ok",

  "Best mix. Very clear and well balanced.",

  "Too much reverb, vocals too loud, too much reverb. My god turn down that reverb. Frequency balance is alright but that reverb! Did I mention that it's probably too much reverb?",
  "Too wet. Midrange sounds good, but vocal verb is super distracting",
  "Interesting but overwhelming vox verb, gets old with time. Great backing vocal sound though.",
  "Reverb time is far too short, singer in the bathroom and not in the same space as the rest of the mix so doesn't bed in at all. Drums are quite bright and fatiguing to listen too.",
  "What's going on? Interesting. Live setting simulation. Catchy.",
  "Large space, echo, live feeling.",
  "Not good.The release sound is too sharp, I means that I feel like I'm hearing the sound in the space.",
  "Inconsistent vocals with too much reverb and lacking gain and compression. Lack of presence and work on the guitars. Excessive pianos in the chorus for mix balance.",
  "Vocal has to much reverb it seems the reverb was put in the vox track instead of an aux send. The drums seem nice. Probably needs more guitar. Keys seem fine.",
  "Weird voice. With a lot of reverb, or better, more than is present in genre music.",
  "Balanced, but the reverb could be better on the vocals. It has too much space.",
  "Loud snare! An the eq on it is funny. Bass is too loud. The reverb on the background vocals is too long and too much.",
  "Too dark, too wet. Not a bad balance between instruments though.",
  "Reverb tiny bit much, nice balance.",
  "lead vocals sometimes not present enough, other times too present, but everything sits generally well",
  "Very dull and flat. Vocals sit on top. Could be a backing track and singer. Vocals too quiet as well.",
  "Drums have nice compression and lots of space in the mix. Bass less prominent.",
  "Nice depth, but the rest is not properly sculpted.",
  "Space, a strong sense of spatiality.",
  "Reverb is too obvious, on the snare particularly. Mix sounds quite lo-fi, almost like it's been mixed down to an unclean tape machine at low IPS. Could use some (more substantial) bus compression to bring everything together.",
  "This mixer has a good EQ example of delay and chorus.",
  "Please turn down those highs! It hurts! Automate that organ. The rest is nice.",
  "vocal needs to be a bit louder, overall it's good",
  "nice top end. just a bit thin.",
  "Great. Good timbral balance (maybe on the bright side), gtr/wurli maybe a little dry",
  "bright vocals/ everything, bass and kik sit nice together, thin vocals",
  "reverb a bit long on bg vox good push on the kick",
  "sounds good",
  "nice punchy drums",
  "Drums a bit too bright, but the best so far. Nice levels. Push the guitar solo bits. When it hits hard, let it get loud! Bass needs more level, needs to support the song. Spread the back vocals out for more impact.",
  "Nice and dry. Yes. More width on the BG vox would be nice. Be careful with the sibilant range. Kick is a bit tubby some times.",
  "Great vocals and best groove balance of the bunch.",
  "fun snare",
  "Very well balanced, tight punch sound that works really well with the music. Music comes through without being hampered by the mix.",
  "Rhodes keys are too dark, makes the articulation muffled - and level too low overall. Solid drums. Good kick/snare/hihat/bass/vocal balance. Ring in the snare is a little distracting.",
  "Drums are too prominent.",
  "ok",
  "Very punchy and fun. A little bright at times but otherwise very pleasant.",
  "Levels are good, but less interesting mix.",
  "nice space, sounds live, punchy drums",
  "Well, but sound is a little bit cold(?)",
  "like float on the surface,",
  "Most professional sounding mix, good bottom end, bright at the top without being offensively so. Vocals well balanced with the instrumental, well spatialised - hammond particularly.",
  "Rhythm sensation sounds very clear and it's a good rock style.",
  "louder ,particularly the drum and small cymbals. the vocal sound like in the middle",
  "Excellent mix. Great balance between frequencies. All elements are noticeable without exaggeration. Bass and kick give the necessary weight to the track.",
  "The kick is a bit too loud. In some moments, the vocals escape from the mix.",
  "The vocals seem very distant. Good balance between the other instruments.",
  "Great drums. Relationship with the bass. The vocals were all very good. I would like to see more relationship between guitar and keys.",
  "I like the definition in the vocals and the balance with the other instruments. Comparatively, it has more definition and brightness than the others. Brightness in the instruments as well. I would increase the volume of the vocals, however.",
  "- Great vocals mix - Great guitars and keyboard mix - Good drums mix",
  "Lack of kick presence in the track. Excessive reverb on the main vocals and lack of gain on it. Lack of well-elaborated EQ and compression on the bass, which for certain frequencies becomes very evident. Good balance between guitars and pianos.",
  "The vocals are a bit distant. And the reverb on the snare is too prominent.",
  "The vocals are not poorly treated, but the rest of the instruments seem more muffled, needing a better balance between volumes. Instruments also need more brightness.",
  "- Great drums mix (particularly the snare) - Great vocals mix - The 2nd guitar could be higher",
  "Missing some strength despite being balanced.",
  "Snare sounds too compressed. The drums lack some brightness. The vocal seems boxed. The rest of the elements are quite hidden.",
  "The vocals seem to be bleeding into the other microphones. It sounds almost like bleeding. Keyboards in the second part of the song could be lower.",
  "The reverb is interesting, creating its own space and differentiating it; however, it does not satisfy me completely.",
  "- Great drums mix (nice snare reverb) - Vocals could be a little bit higher - Bass tpo high",
  "Lack of brightness in the low and high frequencies of the drums. Everything seems to be too focused on the midrange. This characteristic extends to other parts of the music, sounding like low-quality streaming. Despite this, it shows good internal balance between tracks, except for some vocals in the chorus that are excessively loud.",
  "The voice is too loud, and the volumes between the various backing vocals are unbalanced. Overall, the entire mix lacks any brightness and definition. The mix is quite monophonic, making it less interesting and more predictable.",
  "The guitar has good definition, and so does the voice. The rest feels overly compressed (not in terms of compression but in the sense it gives. There is less individuality and brightness in the instruments).",
  "The keyboards are too prominent.",
  "Needs more verb on the backgrounds. Good presence on the lead and good positioning in general, too dry?",
  "Best mix, nice verb on vox. good balance. Good drum sound, nice bass. Missing some vocals though?",
  "background little upfront but nice balance",
  "nice punchy drums, bass well balanced with kick. Good overall balance, chorus vocals could blend better",
  "good bass and drums - lead voc good, bg vocs low? chorus bgs better, but gets bright...?",
  "good drums & bass, except for lack of Tomsgood piano; good organ balance 1st BG Vocal missing in V2..FAIL!!!",
  "Snare is thin like everyone else. Eq pretty good, but voice thin. Could use a bit of verb on the back vocals. Levels out of wack, vocals need riding.",
  "nice but hats a bit high",
  "The mix! Nice balance and sonically interesting. Punchy",
  "Maybe the electric guitar could use some panning or some psychoacoustic tricks to be heard better. Amazing mix",
  "Vocals are near perfect: clear and crisp. Guitar/synth during the chorus is perfectly balanced, would have more piano focus but that may be personal preference. And thank you for bringing up the organ! Drums good during the verse, but can be a bit quiet otherwise. Some odd drop in energy going in the chorus though!",
  "The high mid and high end boost is a bit too dramatic, but the rest of the mix is good.",
  "nice tight mix.",
  "too much energy without control",
  "Pretty similar to 6 and 3 just a tad better",
  "I really liked this track. I found the vocals and the instruments well balanced. It feels like listening the band in a jam session in a small cafe, from a table at the back.",
  "Vocals sound quite cold or inhuman, though very clear arrangement. Nice build up to chorus.",
  "keyboard, guitars are too loud in the mix, drums sound far too back, backing vocals are too loud and too reverberant",
  "Too much reverb on pretty much everything. Especially snare! Sounds like the snare is at the back of a church and is barely audible and all reverb. Swimmy and muddy. Guitar is way too quiet and drowning in reverb too. The vocal reverb is too long and/or too high in level. Also track is too compressed.",
  "little too much reverb, bass comes and goes - sounds like too much buss compression... vocs too hot in chorus",
  "truly a terrible mix, nothing more to say than hope noone needs to listen to this again",
  "Thin. Vox sound like they're in a different room/space and are WAY closer than the band.",
  "Too quiet, needs a buss compressor (or a better one) to help keep the energy up when the vocals are out. During chorus everything is lost in the vocals reverbs!",
  "Too much importance for the voice.",
  "Vocal might be a bit more in the back, sounds a bit strong. But still has a soft effect.",
  "Too much reverb on back vocals, or too bright?",
  "Could use brighter snare, less bright and forward hat.",
  "REALLY bright. hi hat sounds unatural and much too forward. way brighter than vocal. Sounds like Hi Hat is the lead instrument. Mixed on dark system?",
  "don't hear piano and electric guitar well, the mix sounds a bit empty without them, backing vocals too loud, nice drums but stick out too much in the mix",
  "Too bright. Good vocal balancing. Good ensemble balance. Good panning. Could use more virb. Sounds like a record.",
  "Chorus Vocals too wide...nice bass. Maybe snare a bit boxy? Nice toms.",
  "nice drums, background vocals a little dry",
  "good drums and bass. too much hihat?. pno gtr too soft? voc a bit dry. good bg vocs. i like the snare",
  "good Bass, Kick muddy LD Voc answers in 2nd verseBG Vocs muddy and not integrated",
  "Wow, so much hi-hat! Split vox & double?",
  "I like the bright drums but it's too much. Snare still sounds like shit. HH way too loud. Toms sound good. Needs de-essing. Balances OK but not great.",
  "Nice compressed sound. Vocal a little quiet?",
  "Drums a bit too much in the face. Great mix. Nice eq, better than track 3",
  "Nice gated snare works well, hi-hat also nice thing to focus on during the verse. Lead vocals should be stronger than the backing! Drums overall are near perfect, but the piano and synths are messy, some surgical EQ needed to resolve. But strong energy throughout.",
  "Nice groove.",
  "Dry and tight. Clean. Hihat sounds a little bit harsh though.",
  "Mix feels spacious, with the vocals right at the front of the mix. Really nice mix",
  "good, I can hear many things. I don't like the sound of the drums ( too much tpp\u00e1h...)",
  "Well balanced",
  "Subtle reverb is nice. Good equalization. All instruments sound present and not too distant, good dynamic balance. Drums sound sufficiently present and punchy.",
  "Pretty dry...",
  "Lots of presence on the bass, too much? Dry in general. Not bad except for the bass level.",
  "very dry mix, keyboard too buried in the mix, drums is a bit loud in the mix, overall could use more reverb to improve the blend",
  "Balances pretty good! Bass is very up front - like that. Kick is a little low. But overall this is good.",
  "Good spread of vocals in chorus, snare a bit quiet. nice bass sound.",
  "good overall mix, could be slightly brighter? I would like the kick to punch a bit more.",
  "good balances, some super low stuff on the bass should be filtered (40hz pops). good ng vocs, but they're all in the middle?? spread em out. lead voc sounds good",
  "pretty good Bass and Kick...no, wait the drums don't hold up throught the tunegood vocal mix in V2 BG Vocs too much organ in C's",
  "Good but need a bit more sub bass.",
  "Voice too important comparing to the groove of the music.",
  "Lacks some brightness, air and punch. Good effort on the stereo image however.",
  "I like this one but 1 seems to be a bit more balanced",
  "very simple but works well for this song",
  "Back vocals and instruments well balanced. Gives the impression that I am in a nice atmosphere.",
  "Mellow. Organ-heavy. Can hear guitar and bass very clearly.",
  "More bass is nice but perhaps too high for some. Good equalisation and balance between instruments. Drums lack presence a bit",
  "Background vocals don't need to be quite as loud, need to be balanced better left to right, need more verb.",
  "snare sounds too high and hollow, don't hear piano and electric guitar that well, backing vocals heavy on the left side, lead vocal could be louder during chorus, could use more organ",
  "Lead vox sounds veiled. Drums too dark. Nice ensemble balance.",
  "Vocals are too dry. A little bit of reverb would be nice. I like the way the kick and the bass interact. BG vocals need to be balanced a little better. The one on the left stands out and there are some harmonies that are lost.",
  "snare could be brighter, mix overall too dry. good balances",
  "voc too dry. needs to be in a space. kick is a bit thumpy, snare slappy. good balances, maybe more piano in places would be good?",
  "pretty good Bass and Kick where's the verb on LD V? LD V not mixed where's the perspective between LD and LD BG in C2??",
  "I like the dryness, but the vocal needs a little bit of verb. Levels OK, but vocal needs riding. Back vocals unbalanced. DRUMS STILL BOXY.",
  "Too dry. Mostly just the drums need calming down, the snare cracks through too much. Maybe better with some reverb. When vocals are not present it is just dead. However during the chorus the energy swells nicely.",
  "Looks like the track 2.",
  "Nice mix. Vocals could be put a bit more to the front. The instrumentation is almost dominating the vocals.",
  "Punchy vocals with subtle reverb. Levels are good, nice mix.",
  "groovy I like it. good bass and voiceovers. nice balance of everything",
  "more prominent vocals",
  "Less low frequency may be better.",
  "There was a distinctive back vocal in this track, sounds like I just discovered a back vocal lady that I didn't hear in the other tracks.",
  "Really like interplay of back vocals and vocals and how they mesh and move differently depending on their role in the arrangement, and the words. Vocals are warm.",
  "Needs less high/mid end on drums. In general good dynamic balance between instruments and good. Good equalisation. Could do with more reverb.",
  "reverb is too long on the lead vocal, piano is too low, drums are too loud but reverb is good. snare is dark, backing vocals should be louder",
  "Background vox WAAY too low. Drums too roomy. Where is the guitar? Where are the Keys? Lead vocal, bass, and drum room does not a mix make. Good snare volume.",
  "Vocal reverb is too long and/or too loud and/or too bright. Metalic. It's distracting. The snare reverb is too high in the mix as well. The BG vocals are quite a bit too quiet - need a lot more presence. The lead vocal level needs to be automated better - stuff jumps out and gets lost. Vocals are harsh. Mix needs more clarity. I think this is the robot.",
  "good balance, too much reverb, response vocals don't blend in.",
  "lots o voc reverb...voc way too far out front. kick too roomy needs more kick and less OHs. bass light. bg vocs too soft. snare good",
  "Quite strong. Reverbs used are good. Instrumentals and little hooks and guitar rifts should be emphasised more to fill those little gaps. Backing vocals are far to quiet.",
  "Clear sound with reverb.",
  "BVs are too low. Drums too wet: they sound far behind: more dry sound would be great.",
  "Drums have a lot of punch. Levels are good. Possibly a little too much reverb.",
  "Like being able to hear dynamics in the voice clearly. Back vocals don't mesh as well with main vocals. Too loud?",
  "Too much reverb and drums are too high in mix although this could be down to preference. Conversely, sense of expanse is nice.",
  "Nice snare, good verb. Maybe a bit much on the snare? BG could come up. and don't need to be fully spread L to R",
  "oo big snare reverb - cool. voc good, bg voc too dry and low in places. mostly good balances",
  "LD Voc needs much more compression Drums not too bad, but the rev's not good REALLY bad LD and BG balances too much organ, too little EGtr pad in Choruses",
  "Very nice. Drums slightly too wet?",
  "Not balanced. Vocals are lost, some words are not heard. Backing synths/guitars are too strong. Drums are far too strong and are too dry given the reverb on everything else.",
  "Tonal balance not ideal. Beyond the false impression of warmth, the mix is fairly bassy and therefore doesn't sound very open at all.",
  "bass is too loud, and taking too much space in the spectrum. Vocals are burried under layers of organ, guitars and drums and don't cut through",
  "there's a curtain, interesting tones of the bass",
  "generally well balanced mix",
  "Drums sound very nice. Subtler reverb sounds nice. Good balance between instruments. Good equalisation.",
  "More low end. Nice balance. Make chorus hit harder.",
  "VERB bright. perhaps a little too much",
  "can hear the lead vocal reverb tail very obviously...too long drums sound compressed, don't hear piano and electric guitar that well, too much reverb on backing vocals",
  "Reverbs on vocals and guitar are way too long! Distracting. Mix is a bit bright. Generally ok balances.",
  "too much predelay on main vocals, nice balance",
  "too much voc reverb. kick bass too soft. guitar too soft in verse. bg vocs good",
  "nice mix.",
  "The use of the reverb at the beginning of the track is very interesting, it would be interesting to hear the section immediately before to better understand if this is actually great. The mix is not very convincing otherwise. A bit too much reverb",
  "Guitar's are nicely balanced. Drums are clear but not overly heavy (snare could again calm down a bit more) but the reverb here works to fill the gaps between the beats. Vocal reverb too strong some-times, some automation or input compression to reduce reverb strength in load parts.",
  "Nice spacious mix",
  "reverb, not bad.",
  "vocals too thin and present, but overall nice eq but a little too much space",
  "A little too much reverb and vocals are a little too high in mix. Apart from this everything is good.",
  "Little less rhythm guitars. More vocal, and more verb on vocal. This has the most bass, I like that.",
  "good definition on guitars. good level on lead. guitar may be a little loud. winning mix. good bass foundation",
  "lead vocal volume can be louder, some words can't be heard as well, drums and gutiars could come out more during chorus",
  "GTR verb is over done. Good snare. not enough kick at all. good GTR levels and freq balance. Lead vox too harshly compressed.",
  "Vocals too quiet. Rhythm guitar too loud. Too much verb on lead guitar - it sounds far away. I like the snare Balance of vocals gets better at the chorus.",
  "Good snare sound, good vocal sound.",
  "overall good mix, hi hat a bit loud. guitars are nice, slightly thin. nice bass",
  "voc lost at top. bass is hot. drums good. voc dry. bg vocs could be louder",
  "pretty good mix, too much rev on Slide EGtr. mistaken mix between Chorus EGtr and Slide",
  "Not bad, but bland. Kick thin. Bass a little hot.",
  "Decent EQ, but snare has no life. Panning pretty good. Guitars too compressed and quiet. Chorus weak, need more sustained instruments.",
  "Guitar doubling not well done, gets a bit incoherent. Vocals present and clear. Drums could be stronger, especially going into the chorus. Some clicks at start of chorus.",
  "Punchy rhythm section, but vocals don't manage to cut through very well.",
  "Backing vocals not loud enough. Generally like how the guitars sound when mixed together probably due to eq and panning.",
  "nice mix",
  "In the first verse lead voice has not enough presence. However, now the balance between the lead voice and the slide is good. I like how the choirs sit in the back in part C and the mix between the dry lead voice and the same line with chorus in part B is pleasing. In general, I like how the effects (reverb and chorus) have been used in the mix. Bass too loud.",
  "Kick is weirdly clicky. Needs more body and needs to sound more like a kick drum. Not very intersting - could use more shaping of the mix. But reasonable balances. Bass is a little light.",
  "Drums too compressed. You can hear them pumping. Good rhythm guitars, vocal placement.",
  "good mix, kick has nice attack but lacking of the low end, good dynamic change in chorus. guitars are good but I could use slightly more low end to give them more weight.",
  "vocals out of perspective - too loud drums too light, Snare thin EGtrs not mixed. BG's also not mixed. not sure what has been mixed.one of the only mixes i can hear the tamborine",
  "Nicely balanced, although a little quiet",
  "Separating the guitar doubling is great! Adds huge amount of depth. Drum reverb is well timed as well, but watch for pumping on the compressor, makes it more like a gunshot. Also keep the reverb during the chorus build-up where the drums are the focus point.",
  "drums are a bit too far back. They don't bring impact and dynamics to the track as they should",
  "Kick drum not cutting through. Lot of reverb on lead vocals, noticeable at quieter part.",
  "too energetic at high volume, Rock...",
  "Full sound, nice reverb on vocals - sharp kit. lacking in LF.",
  "vocals a bit loud, strange EQ, but good",
  "Plain. Reverb adjustment for the voice is better than track 2 for my taste.",
  "The live feeling is very strong.",
  "this mix is better.",
  "Plentiful mix. However, the vocality is a bit weaken. The rhythm of the drum-kit is good. Especially the fluctuation.",
  "Lead vocal is too dry compared to the rest of the band. Snare a little quiet. Fairly good balance overall.",
  "Slide a bit loud. Good kick / snare. Drums need to come up during chorus. Stays flat...",
  "guitars are dark and wimpy. I like the snare. vocals feels disconnected from rest.",
  "voc too loud, and up and down. good snare. good bass. wimpy tambourine",
  "Decent drums. Good bass",
  "Decent drum sound, I like the vocal but too dry. Guitars too set back. Slide gtr needs verb or something.",
  "Really nice use of stereo field. Lead vox a little dry?",
  "Vocals sound too close. Very similar to track 2, but a little more central. Vocals are just too dry. Same comment as track 6, needs to be stadium filling! Energy is just dumped going into the chorus, then the vocals are way too strong during the chorus. Shame as the verse is pretty good.",
  "Missing some top end. Good separation of backing vocals.",
  "Nice mix, levels are good.",
  "Very clear vocals and drums",
  "nice mix",
  "I prefer this one to track 0. More clear dynamics, choir panning corrected. Still hard to differentiate the slide guitar. Part A is dry compared to track 5, but part C is better.",
  "lead vocal is small, guitars are buried too much in the mix, backing vocals too loud",
  "Bass is muddy. Kick needs more point. Would like snare to be brighter. Vocals are a little too recessed.",
  "voc good. kick needs more point, bass is dark. bd voc too hot",
  "good warm drum / bass / egtr mix lead vocal not integrated; B-Sect & Chorus BG vocals unconvincing. Chorus BG's a big, big mistake",
  "Guitars too big, masking everything else. Vocal too bare. De-ess please. Drums too quiet. Vocal too loud. Too mono. Back vocals way too loud.",
  "Softer sound but feels natural and well balanced",
  "Energy just lacking. Vocals sound close when this should be stadium filling, needs reverb. Energy drops in the build up to the chorus! Drums are just lost completely.",
  "Vocals sound flatter",
  "Nice space, but a little flat, especially in the kit. To much",
  "the voice is too prominent.",
  "Good drums. Good vocals. Good lead guitar fills and rhythm guitar levels. Chorus hits hard, fucken eh! Easy on the tambo there tho",
  "Good pop on snare, but perhaps a little much. wide imaging. widest mix? best drums and snare.",
  "overall good balance and panning",
  "I like the snare verb. Nice, balanced overall EQ. Like panning of BG vocals.",
  "Nice bass / drums. Best snare by far. Good vocal placement. Really good mix. Maybe BG vocals in the chrous a bit hot...",
  "Snare reverb a little long for the mix, may be too wet. nice vocal",
  "vocals seem too forward, doesnt connect with rest of band. good drums but too much verb on the snare. overall good balances.",
  "like the drums. bass is dark. voc very hot,but good... good mix",
  "good drum presence; nice rev on snare good Slide EGtr position, level main EGtr's not big enough Lead vocal not quite integrated in track",
  "Good snare! Strong drums overall, but kick a bit pointy.",
  "Nicely balanced but lacking some power",
  "Drum reverb is perfectly timed, but could use more energy. Same as track 3, keep the reverb in for the fill into the chorus. Something like Red Hot Chilli Peppers!!",
  "nice stereo image.",
  "All instruments audible, EQ sounds well balanced for each as well as good use of pan, especially on backing vocals.",
  "Great mix, good levels with good separation. Drums have really good impact.",
  "I like it also at high volume",
  "Space is great. nice kit sound. Nice dynamics.",
  "vocals too prominent, instruments panned to L channel",
  "Clean slide guitar panned too much to centre for my taste, overlaps with the main voice and it's imperceptible. Also, the choirs at the end are too loud and they seem to be more present on the right, the result is slightly annoying and masks the lead voice. A little plain on dynamics too?",
  "Stronger mix effect.",
  "Lots of envelopment in comparison. reverb heaven. drums could be more defined",
  "very reverberant overall, maybe too much, drums sounds small compared to the guitars. don't hear the keyboard in the mix, nice balancce between backing vocal and lead vocal",
  "If one decided to mix this like an arena rock song with lots of reverb, this is not how one should do it. IOW too much reverb. Needs more drums... lots more. This is how to not get laid.",
  "Good drum sound, maybe a bit too quiet. Right guitar louder than left...a bit distractions. prechorus is good.",
  "voc bathed in funny reverb. guitars floating abit in processing. good kick. snare needs more core",
  "Nice wide mix, slightly too much reverb?",
  "Too much reverb on the voice at the beginning. Rhythm guitar too loud compared to the slide guitar. Better choir dynamics and separation.",
  "drums sound far back and too diffuse, left guitar jumps out too much than the right guitar, backing vocals get a bit loud than the lead vocal",
  "Good mix, but needs drums up and more bass. Basically it sounds \"safe\"...Thinking if it had a bit more ooomf in the lows it would be great.",
  "Nice stereo image, needs a little more snap on the snare and punch on drums",
  "Need more kick. guitars nice. Slide guitar too loud, covering vocal. Back vocals too much. Not horrible balances.",
  "Verse is so strong! Guitars placed brilliantly with good reverb. Vocals are not stable, continuously changing in volume and at some points it is a real struggle to hear. Going into the chorus, the energy is dropped as the drums are just not strong enough. Chorus starts off well but the backing vocals are stronger than the lead",
  "mid range a bit muddy. Vocales can't cut through",
  "Nice balance /separation of guitars. Lead vocals a bit low in mix",
  "Nice and full sounding.",
  "There is something off with the slide guitar, maybe too much reverb compared with the rest in part A, so it does not mix quite right. The choir in part C is too loud too. However I liked part B a lot in this one, the mix between dry and 'chorused' voice is perfect, and the instrument with chorus in the back (guitar or organ) sounds better than in any of the other tracks.",
  "It is not very suitable in the concert. Too much compressed. The main melody is good.",
  "Make snare pop more. Good vocal.",
  "Lead a little harsh and loud. not a bad balance.",
  "left guitar is too loud and sticks out, interesting effect for the chorus vocal, nice snare drum, could use more bass, overall could use more reverb",
  "This is good. Lead vocal is perhaps too midrangy.",
  "Lead guitar conflicts with the vocals sometimes. Kick and snare are a nice level. Overall very good. Full sound.",
  "Slide guitar?? Way too hot. Tiny snare. Vocals needs to leveled out way more....Words sticking out like crazy. Cool effect on the prochorus",
  "voc bright/nasal but good level?. bass dark? chorus balances good",
  "Nice clear vox. Slide guitar distracting.",
  "Unbalanced. Demo? Interesting ideas for the real mix?",
  "Vocals are wonderfully crisp. Everything sounds big and rocky. Interesting vocal effects before the chorus, but if you are going to do something like this also add space, having phasor central just sounds weird. Guitar doubling is great. Snare is good but rest of the kit just lost (is it just a snare and micro hi-hat).",
  "'lead' guitare is a bit loud, and takes too much space off the lead vocals. Good vocals presence. This rhythm section sounds a bit thin.",
  "Like the right pan of rhythm guitar. Can hardly hear tambourine. Bass seems a little thin.",
  "weak compared to others, but kind of well weighted. the singer seems to 'spit' too much in front.",
  "where has the Bass gone! Sharp vocals, but vocal effect is unnecessary. Too much compression, percussion disappears... nice space",
  "Nice stereo spread. Vocals a little nasaly.",
  "Now the slide guitar is too present and panned to left. It creates some separation, but is not appealing. The chorus in the voice in part B is too extreme.",
  "The hi-hat feels a bit too prominent to me; it stands out quite a bit. Nice bass sound, definitely. Overall, a cool mix!",
  "What first catches my attention is the guitar on the left in the mix. It seems like it has a lot of noise, giving me the feeling that something is interfering. Everything else is well audible. I find the balance between guitars and vocals pleasant. However, in the midrange, there's an annoying frequency around 3.15Hz, making it sound aggressive.",
  "Beautiful stereo image. Nice clear sound. Everything has its place in the mix.",
  "This mix relies heavily on the snare and bass, somewhat succeeding in creating an atmospheric feeling. From a mixing perspective, it's a very bright mix. In mono, it loses much of its strength. However, the atmosphere and depth work well at times, reminiscent of an Echo And The Bunnymen production from the 1980s.",
  "Hi-hat is quite loud compared to the rest of the drums. I don't like the sound of the snare (it's a bit too snappy), and I miss some kick. The vocals sit well in the mix. Bass could be a bit quieter or the guitar a bit louder, but this is a detail. I find this mix okay.",
  "The song sounds clear, but perhaps a bit too bright, making it sound a bit harsh. There's a lack of kick, and there's too much hi-hat in the drums. However, the proportions and the overall atmosphere are good.",
  "Bit too bright and thin",
  "Too bright, snare sounds like it is clipping at times",
  "It seems the best mix",
  "Too thin and airy. Good cohesion otherwise.",
  "Too bright. Vocals fatiguing to listen to and the tambourine. Rest of the song very muddy though, which is very distracting when the vocals not present. Disjointed. But good energy throughout.",
  "drum\uff0csome noise in track\uff0cnot comfortable",
  "Not bad, but vivid sound.",
  "Bass is well obvious and controlled. Sound good.",
  "In the low-mid, there seems to be something that lingers and is a bit distracting. Can't immediately identify the source, could it be an acoustic guitar? Otherwise, the mix sounds very spacious, definitely a cool mix. The hi-hat might be a bit imbalanced compared to the rest of the drums.",
  "Finally, a song with bass. Yes, there is indeed too much bass. The combination of bass and bass drum is indistinguishable. However, I find the overall balance between guitar and vocals in this song good.",
  "Too much low end in the bass, sound-wise it's okay, but maybe apply it more subtly. The balance is alright, but there isn't really a sense of depth created; everything is quite close together.",
  "A clear mix with prominent vocals, although it's generally scooped in the mid. This shifts the balance towards the sub. The spatiality works very well and gives air to the whole mix. In mono, the mix somewhat retains its strength, but it's noticeable that the rhythm guitar is not well-balanced.",
  "The bass has too much sub. The drums are relatively soft. The vocals sound good but could use a bit more compression and be a bit brighter. Too much hi-hat in the drums. Guitars sound good but could perhaps come forward a bit more (brighter/less reverb).",
  "- The sub-bass from the bass is unbelievably loud. Everything else is pushed away in comparison; it's hard to provide feedback. As far as I can hear, the rest of the mix is okay. - Reverb on the drums is nice. - The loudest part of the drum here is the hi-hat, which is unusual.",
  "I would appreciate some pannings, The guitar is too low",
  "good depth and spread",
  "Too bright sounding maybe",
  "lacks mids and too much bass for the style, but ok atmosphere and vocals nice",
  "low sound range(?) is strong",
  "Big bottom end; borderline unruly but could be tweaked at mastering. Vocals a little bit lost, instrumental elements are mixed in a pleasant, unobtrusive manner.",
  "The BGM of this mixing is not well-arranged at the beginning but when gradually entering its own rhythm, it sounds better.",
  "better",
  "The bass drum sound is not really my thing, and there is also no connection between the bass and the bass drum; they don't blend very precisely. However, it's cool that the drums are more prominent in the mix here. The percussion is also clearly present, definitely a plus!",
  "A very neat mix. It shows a good understanding of the genre. There isn't an excessive amount of highs or lows. The balance between guitars and vocals is well done. Sufficient space has been left for instruments in this mix.",
  "The mix has a very wide stereo image. The vocals sit nicely in the mix. The drum and bass are well balanced. Perhaps bring the guitars slightly more to the forefront.",
  "I miss a bit of bass. I find the kick quite good in this mix; it has more attack. Maybe add a bit more guitar occasionally; I miss that too. Otherwise, I find this okay.",
  "Something is missing in the song. It seems like a part of the filling is missing. The bass guitar and drums are good. More guitars could be added. The song sounds quite clear and pleasant.",
  "- Again, too much sub-bass in the bass. - Guitars sound pretty cool. Acoustic guitar is too loud and doesn't contribute much to this song. The rest of the guitars are a bit quiet compared to it. - Nice atmosphere, drums are a bit on the loud side, but fortunately, they sound good, especially the snare",
  "Best mix overall",
  "Punchy, good drum and bass sound. We can hear the acoustic guitar (e.g. hidden in a lot of other mixes). Need more cohesion between the acoustic and electric guitars. A bit less hi-hat. Good width.",
  "Vocals feel muted and muddy, some clarity missing, more highs needed. Guitars feel nice. Drums are punchy and clean, but sometimes need more power to drive the song.",
  "thin image, guitar on its own - interesting",
  "Bass is nice and defined in this one. More panning needed",
  "expect singer voice got some special effect to mix the music better",
  "Rhythm sensation is excellent and EQ is greatly controlled. Sounds very comfortable. I like it most.",
  "good",
  "One of the guitars sounds a bit nasal here, which immediately makes the mix a bit restless. In my opinion, the vocals could also be a bit more prominent in the mix. I also mix in some bass; it's very deep under the mix.",
  "This could use a bit more brightness and wideness. The guitar seems a bit loud and sounds bad, taking up a lot of space with those resonances. Other mixes that sound better here have less guitar and more highs. The drums are cool though.",
  "The mix sounds clean, but perhaps a bit too empty as a result. Guitars sound good but could use a bit more effects to fill it out. The guitars are also a bit too loud. There's a lack of effect/EQ on the snare. The bass guitar could come through a bit louder.",
  "-Your guitars are a bit strange. (I think guitar amp + room signal are panned left and right.) You have one guitar that sounds loud, and the rest hangs under it. -Drums sound pretty good; the kick might be a bit loud, but it's not really bothering. It propels the song a bit. -The mix sounds extremely empty.",
  "Nice but some panning should be added to all the instruments",
  "Good cohesion. Punchy. Acoustic guitar disappeared but it works well simply with the electric one (creative choice). Instruments dominate a bit the vocals.",
  "Guitars not strong enough to support the vocals. Drums quite nice but not balanced well with the bass guitar. Some odd notes are prominent on the bass but not others, quite distracting. Vocals nice and controlled. Guitars too loud",
  "too much prominence of bass, but lively. Voice quiet but everything clear. boxy drums.",
  "The guitar really shines through on this one nicely. Vocal could maybe be higher",
  "Bright, guitar.",
  "too separated .feel like the musical instrument performed in different place",
  "The guitars are a bit too prominent in my opinion, they are quite forward. It seems like the vocals sometimes have to compete with the guitars, as if they are working against each other. It makes it a bit tiring to listen to.",
  "A mix that, due to its balance choices, feels very natural and almost reminiscent of a Neil Young production. The choice of (stereo) delay on the vocals is very interesting but is not always well-controlled, making it sometimes disruptive. The kick is more suggested than pronounced, but this surprisingly works well in the overall context. In mono, the mix retains much of its strength, but the vocals sound very dry, compromising the atmosphere somewhat. The attitude in this mix is very good, thanks to the 'loud' guitars and direct approach. The mix sounds a bit nasal, but due to the good balance choices, this could be addressed in mastering.",
  "Here, too, the hi-hat is quite loud compared to the rest of the drums. The guitar comes through more here, but sometimes it stands out too much. The bass could be a bit louder compared to the guitar. The vocals sit quite well in the mix.",
  "The balance is good.",
  "Everything has its place well, the vocals remain prominent, and the overall mix sits in a nice space.",
  "There's a lot of mid-high in the overall song. The guitars and vocals seem to be in the same frequency range. The song could sound more open. The vocals sound reasonably good, so I think the issue might be with the guitars. Otherwise, the song is good.",
  "- A lot of sub-bass in the bass, which this song definitely doesn't need. - Vocals lack some clarity. - A lot of hi-hat, it really stands out above the rest of the drums. - The grittiness in those guitars sounds cool. - Nice atmosphere!",
  "Not bad, cannot hear the acoustic guitar",
  "Very similar to track 5. However the vocals just miss some bedding in from the reverb in track 5. Sits on top of the mix during the chorus which really lets it down.",
  "all the sound is strong, so not mixed well.",
  "Snare is a bit polite, the rest of the mix is 6music worthy. Quite middle-y, but pleasant all the same."
