  "It's very disturbing that the backing track of the lead is running along. They are not in sync. In terms of balance, it's not a bad mix overall, but I just can't listen to it. It irritates me immensely.",
  "The mix lacks presence in the vocals. Due to the loud cymbals, you would expect the vocals to be EQed to sound 'fresher.' In mono, the mix loses some of its strength, and the uncontrolled vocals are particularly noticeable.",
  "The mix sounds quite empty. Perhaps make more room through EQ?",
  "-The vocals sit well in the mix, but there seems to be a very dull delay on the lead, and it doesn't sound good. -Instruments in this mix seem heavily EQ'd just to cut through the mix, but they don't sound pleasant. I miss definition. -The chorus has a strange balance, it's almost only drums, vocals, and keys, while there is much more in it.",
  "vocals get lost in places",
  "barely can hear drums. voice it too present and not improved.",
  "some delay effect",
  "The mix derives its atmosphere from the delay on the vocals, providing an interesting spatial quality. The transition from verse to chorus works very well. Because the cymbals are mixed so loudly, they tend to smear a bit at times, which is unfortunate for the overall impact. In mono, the mix retains almost its full strength, but it becomes noticeable that the vocals are still somewhat uncontrolled.",
  "Hi-hat is louder than the rest of the drum kit, which is a bit bothersome to me. Again, the vocals seem to fade away a bit.",
  "Perhaps the vocals are a bit too quiet, and there's a slight excess of reverb. It sounds very expansive, but I wonder if it might be a bit too much at times. The cymbals sound really washy. There might also be a bit too much hi-hat in this mix. The low end doesn't sound 100% tight to my ears.",
  "Vocals are a bit too quiet, the bad sound of the guitar recording is very obvious here",
  "Vocals hard to hear. Weird reverb going on.",
  "Distant vocals create a muffled effect and for a pop/rock track this is not a desirable outcome. Vocals should have been placed a lot more in \"front\". This makes it a poor mix but instruments seem quite balanced otherwise",
  "drum is grate / some delay effect",
  "The vocals stand out significantly above the mix; they almost overshadow the guitars completely. In the chorus, everything fades away except for vocals and drums; the musical aspect almost disappears, which is a bit unfortunate.",
  "There is time invested in this mix, with a lot of effects and vocals pushing the rest to the background. Guitars are not audible at all. I find it to be a poor mix.",
  "Few guitars, a lot of vocals with not so pleasant EQ, but it sounds open. A gap in the low-mid.",
  "The vocals are too loud, and there's a lack of drums and bass, especially in the chorus. If the vocals were less loud, it would solve a lot.",
  "Too much reverb and the vocals are too predominant. Too much air/HF on the hi-hat which is too loud, tiring for the ears. Weird delay on the vocals in the chorus.",
  "dreamy, edgy at high, voice far too prominent and screaming - rough",
  "Too much reverb. Bass isn't very well defined. Neither is the kick.",
  "vocal is harsh",
  "The vocals sound quite dull. More highs in the mix?",
  "The voice is too low compared to the other instruments",
  "This lacks a bit of punch, and there seems to be an EQ effect on it that makes it sound a bit distorted/played over bad speakers",
  "I hear a lot of vocals, a bit less guitar, and somewhere far back, drums. There's little definition, and unfortunately, I don't hear any effects.",
  "Guitars sound a bit messy at times but are audible. Vocals are not very clear at the beginning. In the chorus, the vocals come in quite abruptly and are too loud, which I don't find pleasing. The vocals are not deep enough in the mix during the chorus. I miss a bit of sub and cymbals. The balance of the drums is not quite right; cymbals and toms are too quiet compared to the kick and snare. The balance could be better overall.",
  "Lacking body, vocals get lost in the mix. Quite dry.",
  "Too few drums. The guitars are prominent but don't sound good, not clear. The vocals could also benefit from sounding clearer with more effects.",
  "-Lack of highs, lack of lows. -The drums are really out of place, they are too quiet. -Guitars are too loud in the verses. -Balance is better in the choruses. Overall, this mix is quite okay.",
  "Vocals too low. Guitar too loud. Generally very poor balance.",
  "No bottom end, no high end. All midrange. Vocals are hidden behind the too-loud guitars",
  "Everything is too compressed, there is lack of dynamics, and it is too filtered, in particular low frequencies are too filtered",
  "Overall very middy. Lacking bass and highs. Guitars are nice. Drums have no energy at all, no kick and snare is muted. Vocals very dry and stand out, though don't bed well.",
  "too much cutting -",
  "Tinny with no bottom end...",
  "Doesn't get very clear until the vocal vocal bursts through. Guitar hard to hear correctly.",
  "guitar and drum is weird",
  "Good but the guitar is too present and not well panned in my opinion",
  "Something's wrong with the eq on this one?",
  "the balance is ok , but I do not like it",
  "That mix seriously lacks punch, I guess the drums should be more present",
  "Bad, unnatural midrange, sounds like an mp3",
  "doesn't sounds clear. very poor mastering",
  "Vocals a little lost in the drums.",
  "Attenuated high frequencies on vocals are the most prominent feature here. Everything else seems quite well balanced but this EQ is making the mix dirty and therefore it's not a desirable effect. Fair mix",
  "the vocal sound is a little bit vague",
  "channel balance is kind of weird",
  "Elements overly compressed. Difficulty hearing the drums. Good presence of vocals and bass. There is an excess of reverb and gate that makes the snare sound very mechanical. Good use of pans on the drum toms, but lacking in low end and presence of overheads.",
  "Vocals too distant due to the choice of reverb and also due to poor equalization, bass lacks presence, Hammond too loud at times.",
  "Seems like i'm hearing this out of a tape deck.... I need to tilt my head to listen to this one... bad panning..",
  "Voice with too much reverb becomes too hidden among the other elements. Effect on the guitar doesn't help the mix. Too much reverb on the snare. Everything sounds very distant and lacks power.",
  "Mix is quite boxed. drums and bass are so low and masked. some weird things are happening to the vocals. Again the keyboards seem to stand out.",
  "Weak mix, excessive overheads, poorly equalized snare, vocals lacking presence.",
  "Vocals are not well defined and lack presence. The synthesizer is detached from the mix. And there's a lack of body in the guitars and drums.",
  "I miss highs in the vocals. Too many mid-lows make the mix 'boring' and heavy. Crash cymbal is too loud in the chorus.",
  "Needs a bit more vocals. The vocal seems a little dead. Drums don't have any punch to them. Guitars are a little \"low middy\". Back vocals are too loud when compared to the main vocal.",
  "The vocals could be a bit louder and slightly less dry. The keyboard element could be a bit higher in the verse to add more dynamism to the music. Drums in general could be louder, but paying attention to the cymbals. Choruses in the chorus are too loud. Crash cymbal too loud in the chorus.",
  "The drums don't have any room to them. The vocal is quite low and masked by the other elements. the back vocals need to be tighter, and they seem to disappear in the mix. Mix tends to the left. The guitar in the middle 8 is quite loud.",
  "The definition of the elements helps to understand the music better. Guitar too loud, especially from the pre-chorus, stealing attention from the vocals. The vocals are not very present from the pre-chorus. Crash cymbal too loud in the chorus. If the vocals were slightly higher in the chorus, the mix would be, in my opinion, more balanced.",
  "Attempting to pull the guitar to the left highlighted it compared to the rest of the instruments, making things a bit strange. The vocals are not pleasant to listen to.",
  "The guitars and vocals are too loud compared to the rest of the instruments, making the predominant tone the midrange of the guitars and vocals, which makes the mix a bit aggressive. Despite the guitars being open (stereo), overall, the mix is not benefited because all the other information is too centered. The use of reverbs, especially on the drums, puts all the instruments quite distant and very separated, it doesn't seem like they are playing together.",
  "The voice sounds strange, muffled, and the tambourine is too loud compared to the rest.",
  "The volume balance between instruments is quite unbalanced. The kick and snare are too loud compared to everything else. The use of reverb on the guitars makes the whole melody quite confusing and in a different space from the instruments. Overall, the mix seems very closed, with too much bass and little definition. Throughout the song, there are too many fluctuations in the dynamics of the voice, causing some words to be lost slightly at times.",
  "- Good drum mix (dry snare) - Base guitar too low - Bass too low",
  "The equalization of the vocals is strange. It seems concentrated on the higher frequencies only.",
  "- Missing some bass to the final mix - Back vocals too high - Bass guitar too low (could be higher and more powerfull) - Guitar too much on the right - Missing some reverb to the vocals",
  "In general, the volume of all instruments is well balanced. I notice only that the guitar is sometimes slightly louder than the rest of the instruments, and the snare is relatively low. Timbrically, the drums lack presence, and the guitar is making the mix sound average and muddled. The use of reverbs and delays worked well, providing depth and space to the mix. The vocals seem to be filtered excessively.",
  "I dislike an element of the drums that I can't identify, even listening to the other songs. It's present and a bit bothersome. A sound that seems like a 'scratching' of some sort. The guitar is a bit muffled.",
  "The bass is too low. It ends up overshadowing some of the other instruments.",
  "The vocals are too loud compared to the other instruments, and the drums are slightly low. The mix is somewhat muddled in terms of frequency and lacks definition. All sounds are heavily compressed, causing them to lose some character and timbre. The spatial aspects are underutilized, making the mix less engaging and confusing. Overall, the mix lacks more definition and presence in the low and high-frequency areas.",
  "Excessive vocals, pianos, and backing vocals in the chorus. Lack of presence in the drums (except for the overheads). Lack of equalization and compression work on the Mix Output to generate more weight and strength in the mids and lows. Lack of brightness and reverb in the vocals.",
  "Vocal is too low and needs a little less reverb.Keyboards are too loud, causing some pumping effect. Drums seem to be in the right place. Guitars seem ok. Keys sometimes cover the voice up.",
  "Voice is too muffled and low. The tail end of reverb in the voice is too audible. Keyboards might be a bit too loud compared to the guitar.",
  "The voice is too prominent and dry. The tambourine is too loud, stealing attention from the other elements. Low frequencies are not prominent enough. I miss the secondary voices that hold the music together between verses.",
  "Very weak mix; low frequencies lacking presence, guitar clashing with the main vocal, tambourine too loud.",
  "The vocals are too boxy, this eq is bad! The back vocals/choir seem ok. The drums need more brightness. Tamborine should be a panned (in my opinion). Guitars seem ok.",
  "Terrible application of vocals throughout the track. Excessive presence of both vocals due to overly elevated panoramas. Vocal1 - left / vocal2 - right. Other elements, especially the drums, are too suppressed, lacking color and brightness. Insufficient dynamics between guitars and bass. Lack of low frequencies and definition in the bass. Missing equalization and compression in the guitar. Excessive panning in the guitars.",
  "The reverb is noticeable on the sibilants. The drums lack definition.",
  "What is happening to these vocals? This mix just seems to have no center. What is going on here? Very creative mix indeed. Terrible balance.",
  "The center becomes too empty when the vocals pan to the right and left. Panorama should be less extreme. The voice is too low during the first part of the song. Snare disappears in the second part of the song.",
  "I like the balance but the vocal is out of control, needs automation and maybe tuck it in a bit. Snare sounds dull and every hit is different. Organ is a bit too wide, not natural",
  "nice vocal balance, maybe a little too much of the verb on main vox, snare is lost, kik sound needs a little lows",
  "bad drum sound - bad lead vocal mix",
  "don't like the vocal ambience that much",
  "bad phase,",
  "Horrible vocal verb. Horrible verbs in general. Drums have a bit of punch at least. Balances OK. Vocal needs leveling.",
  "Snare too soft, weak. Nice vocal level.",
  "Vocals are low, and diluted in a reverb with a lot early echo. This is really not helping them to cut through and to be intelligible.",
  "Vocals a bit too loud. Quite a harsh mix.",
  "Pretty nice, but bit too much reverb, and reproduction quality isn't excellent",
  "Terrible resonance in the low mids, please kill it and burn the body. Vocals too loud and the instruments are a mess.",
  "Missing some presence on the acoustic guitar and punch from the band. A little wet too.",
  "where are the drums? seriously. Nasal vocals.",
  "both guitars up the middle. too much voc reverb. crazy rhodes treatment. where are the drums? 1 800 drums? long distance please come home in time for dinner....",
  "not a mix in any sense of the word. drums ridiculously low. too much verb on vocal and kbd.",
  "no drums? drums too low",
  "The reverb on the vocal doesn't fit, and the guitar and keyboard could come up a bit more.",
  "weird phase in bass",
  "Drums WAY too low. Vocal verb is way too loud. Too much verb overall, no definition. Vocals too loud. Balances are all wrong.",
  "Drums too far, really weird balance. not good.",
  "This is an unorthodox mix. But the effect of muffling the backing instrumentation very nicely serves the lead vocals on the verse. It would be interesting to open the sound a little more on the chorus, that fails to get the lift it needs. There are strange abrupt volume changes in the instrumentation of the chorus. Caused by a bad balance of the ride cymbal vs. HH ?",
  "Less low frequency.",
  "need more reverb for reverb and too much low end in the middle",
  "Drums too dry. Nice vocal (but too low). I like the low mid-punch from the kick/bass, but itsa bit too much",
  "I feel the keyboard and guitar are distracting because they are panned very far, which really makes them sound too big. This isn't aggressive rock and roll, but the kick seems to think so.",
  "Do you hate high frequencies? Way too dark. Weird stereo verb on the guitars, kills the definition. Too much kick. Vocal a bit too quiet.",
  "cool stereo spread, but low end seems a bit much at times",
  "Balance a bit off.. keys are too wide, it's a little nauseating. Low end a little muddy.",
  "Something is wide and phasy and distracting me. Vocals too dry, needs to presence. Kick sticks out. Bass is muffled.",
  "Way too much bass and not well equalised. Generally poor balance.",
  "This bass don't fit well in this song.",
  "Spectral balance massively biased toward its low end. Mix is therefore too boomy. Bass drum microphone is way too loud.",
  "Drums lack impact. Subtle mix.",
  "too much low",
  "Dull acoustically",
  "dig the vocal fx and lo-fi-ness. guitar is too loud and the keys are harsh. side by side with other mixes it falls flat. i like how the drums & bass are presented as a unit, but needing more of them and less of the upper rhythm instruments.",
  "The vox effect is not doing any favors.",
  "goofy voc treatment - am radio? snare is clear, but kick is lugubrious...",
  "fucked up loop (delay) and verb on lead. no support in instruments for vocal. kbd / gtr groove too spread.",
  "bad phase, but interestingh",
  "I don't like the vocal verb, but you went for an effect which is fine. Drums are flat and lifeless, no punch at all. Not enough snare. Guitars too loud sometimes.",
  "This sounds really amateurish - a lot of EQ problems, and that rediculous verb is not helping the singer or the song.",
  "Don't like radio voice.. bass needs a little more level. Weirdness in stereo imaging.",
  "vox is killing me. too much. cool effect but it's always on. drums could be louder to compete with loud rhythm guitar.",
  "Don't like vocal eq and delay sound.",
  "Uncomfortably thin vocals and guitars are too prominent",

  "over compressed, no groove",
  "too dry - doesn't sound like one performance",
  "Low end needs work. electric guitar is too loud. vocal EQ has some problems, sound phasey some times - not helping. Also, if the voice is going to be that dry, you need to work harder on your automation.",
  "Weird low end and low mid heavy, too much! Meeh.",
  "Electric guitar is nice but too forward. No sense of forground, blanace is messy. Vocal is too dry.",
  "Guitar too loud. vocal very dry. Generally not well balanced.",

  "Too much low frequency.",
  "sounds flat, a bit confusing how instruments come together, sounds more harsh",
  "Instrument balance sounds wrong to me, drums are in the back in the begining and in the end they're too loud. There is a resonance in the low mids that clouds up the mix. Vocals get to loud and then go back.",

  "too long vocal reverb with weird color",
  "No bass, too much kick, weird balance.Mix doesnt suit the music. Nice vocals",

  "weird mids, vox too up",
  "can't hear all the instruments well. voice is too far up and distorting in level. poor multichannel balance",
  "Lo-fi? Drums seem very weak, except the kick, which seems out of place. Then in the chorus you need to calm the drums down and keep them in the mix, same with the vocal at the end.",
  "Weird scooped vocal sound.",
  "Vocal feels thinned out, which is nice. But needs more low end to fill under that. Snare too soft, no bite.",
  "toms a bit too loud, low tom especially not well balanced. Bass it a bit low.",

  "Vocals are very far behind. This is bad. Mix is a bit too boomy on top of that.",
  "too much mid, not good balance",
  "vocal gets lost in the hook. its quite low in the verse as well. bass could be higher, or morseo, the guitar could be lower, sounds quite loud in the left channel. the backing vocal comes in louder than the lead.",

  "The reverb on the vocals initially sounds bizarre, although it grows on you. The female choir accompanied the soloist very well. The big problem is the beginning with the instrumental too prominent.",
  "Bass not prominent enough, snare too high.",
  "The female vocals create some discomfort.",
  "Voice with too many mids that make it muffled. Secondary voice with a reverb that doesn't fit. The main voice needed more attention to volumes.",
  "The vocals and the choruses are too loud compared to the entire mix. The overall tone of the mix has an exaggerated presence of a sharp midrange that makes it difficult to listen to. The use of reverbs distances the snare and the vocals too much because they take away definition and cutting.",
  "Missing a bit of body.",
  "Excessive presence in the bass lines. Almost total concealment of pianos and accordions at the beginning of the track, and then a sudden increase causing strangeness. Lack of panning in the acoustic guitars. Lack of presence of the main voice in the pre-chorus part, errors in the cuts and fade outs of the overheads in the chorus, little presence of the female voice throughout the song.",

  "Not a fan of the snare sound. Probably too tight of a gate.",
  "Excess in the bass and vocals, lack of gain in the rhythmic guitar lines, and excess of toms, kick, and snare. Failure in the cymbal lines from the overheads, creating a reverse effect and a too much sense of a 'cut-off' and mixing error, especially in parts without percussion. Poor mix.",
  "Too much reverb on vocals. Back vocals are not well placed. the drums should be a bit brighter. The bass is to high in the mix. Lack of definition all round.",
  "The snare is slightly high compared to the other instruments. Tonally, the entire song has a very prominent midrange, especially in the vocals. The use of reverbs and delay, despite opening the stereo image, adds a midrange timbre that muddies and confuses the mix.",

  "Fairly good balances. Why'd you take out the BGs at 'in spite of my...'? I miss it. Keys are too low in mix. BG vocals need to be tamed a bit - they jump out at times. Snare verb is too long and slappy, especially when everything else is fairly dry.",

  "Drum is dull.",

  "voice cut",
  "I don't like the hi-hat, lacking the highs and any sort of space.",

  "Holy reverb, Batman! Strange strange strange...",
  "Cheap and nasty. Rough demo?",
  "Reverb swamping everything. Does not fit really with this song, the tail is just too long and it is too dense. Lighter and/or shorter reverb would solve this. Beyond this, the drums are too soft for this. Energy from the drums are completely lost.",

  "There is a part interesting during the middle of track 7. Some special design in this track. But the voice of the singer is a bit isolated, not touching.",
  "Overall, a lot of transparency and a wide mix. Not much low-end in the mix. The bass notes are audible but lack body.",
  "Open mix, but aggressive highs, possibly too much master compression? Hi-hat is too loud, and there's not enough snare.",
  "More of a rock feel. The vocals sound watery, and the drum balance doesn't sound familiar. The vocals don't sound good, quite thin.",
  "I miss a bit of kick. I think there's a bit too much very low end in the bass. There's little definition in the low frequencies.",
  "- Bass has a bit too much sub, and it's a bit too loud. - Vocals are somewhat aggressive in the 2-5kHz range and lack highs in other areas. - Balance is pretty good. The mix sounds a bit dirty overall, especially the vocals sounding strange in the highs with a lot of s, t, and p sounds.",
  "A lot of noise is shadowing this mix. It very badly interferes with the distorted guitars and any loud sound really. Sounds very harsh to the ears, not pleasant to listen to.",
  "Vocals have a weird EQ on it",
  "vocals too thin, out of place, disappear in the music, highs annoying",
  "Too much bass! Vocals sound a bit dull. A lot of reverb on the guitars.",
  "There's something disturbing in the low end of this mix. I find this very distracting. Snare sounds thin. Vocals sit well in the mix, but the guitar could be a bit louder and cut through more at times.",
  "A lot of low end, sounds muffled. It's difficult to discern the placement of bass and kick. Perhaps it was mixed in a space where low frequencies pose a challenge.",
  "The bass is really booming at a very low frequency. Quite disturbing. Also, the drums don't come through very well.",
  "Missing the high end, too much bass",
  "Similar to track 3 but more energy throughout. Feels more produced than track 3. Chorus gets a bit messy but the balance throughout is quite nice. Drums too muted and dull, get so lost in the chorus that there is just a sudden drop in energy at the wrong place.",
  "very boomy mix (this is bad!). Vocals don't stand out, the bass masks most of the instrumentation, only the top end of the snare and cymbals manage to cut through.",
  "Omwille van de nadruk op elementen in het hoog, heeft deze mix haast geen mid informatie waardoor het geheel zwak klinkt. Plaatsing van de bas werkt goed, maar krijgt dan ook vrij spel omdat alle gitaren 'ondermixt' zijn. Een mix die meer op suggestie is gebaseerd dan concrete informatie.",
  "Due to the emphasis on high-frequency elements, this mix lacks mid-range information, making the overall sound weak. The placement of the bass works well but has a lot of room since all guitars are somewhat undermixed. A mix that relies more on suggestion than concrete information.",
  "The mix sounds quite empty. Could use more body, not through the bass, but via other instruments.",
  "The drum sound doesn't really match the rest. Too much attack in the snare. Maybe this works well on a small monitoring system (PC speakers).",
  "Quite empty in the mid-range. The individual instruments sound okay, but I think maybe a bit more electric guitar could be added. The bass is also quite loud in the very low frequencies.",
  "The hi hat is harsh",
  "The voice is too low, the guitar should have a higher volume",
  "Harsh top end (heard a lot on HH and ride cymbal). The amount of compression applied (too much) squashes the sound. The mix does not have any air to breathe anymore. Vocals sound very thin and don't cut trough. Drums sound very thin as well (this is bad).",
  "Not mixed well, I can hear all the sound individually",
  "In my opinion, the worst mix. I hear a lot of harshness in the snare. The kick is way too prominent. The balance between guitars and vocals is also off; the guitars often overpower the vocals. I also remember there being an acoustic guitar, but I won't be able to distinguish it.",
  "No nice low/low-mid in the mix; the bass drum sounds very flat, and the bassline disappears completely. Too much 800-2.5k in the mix, making it tiring to listen to.",
  "The vocals are drowned out by the guitars, which are too extreme left/right. It's the only one of the 7 where the bass drum comes through, but immediately too much.",
  "A lot of guitar. I miss the piano a bit.",
  "A straightforward rock mix that sounds wide in stereo due to the placement of the guitars but loses almost all its atmosphere in mono. This indicates a mix where the elements are not fully balanced. The bass is static compared to the rest of the rhythm section. The 'lo-fi' approach to the drums sounds refreshing, but the kick is too messy in its EQ to provide enough power to the foundation.",
  "Don't like the kick. There's something in the low-mid that is disturbing. I miss some bass, it's not well-balanced with the kick. The snare doesn't sound good to me either. Guitars and vocals are well balanced. In this mix, the drum sound bothers me, which I consider a downside.",
  "Don't like the snare",
  "Guitars are too loud. Vocals are way too far back. The tonal balance is terrible.",
  "music too loud ,lack of texture,singer voice too weak",
  "No bass end at all. Mix balance is all off.",
  "This mixing sounds tiring because the voice of bass is a little high, I can't even hear the vocal clearly. And the rhythm is not consistent enough, so I think it's a bit poor.",
  "Compared to the other songs, it's a track with a lot of midrange. The guitars dominate the overall mix. It's fatiguing to the ears. However, this is the first song where I hear a slight slap-back delay, which isn't bad.",
  "The vocals have a strange midrange. Is there little compression on the vocals?",
  "Not bad but vocals a bit low and a bit too much low-mid in the whole mix",
  "Way too much reverb. All the focus and clarity is lost as a consequence. Vocals are diluted in it. This is a shame, the mix is decent otherwise.",
  "low pitch sound too weak,lack of rhythm sensation",
  "Rhythm sensation is ok but EQ seems not very good."
