# MixologyDB

A repo containing JSON descriptions of open-sourced and Creative Commons licensed audio files and their respective parameter values for common audio effect values used within the singular track.

The majority of these tracks come from [The Mixing Evaluation dataset](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/multitrack/MixEvaluation/) by Brecht De Man et al. This repo contains the tools and an example file of the full dataset that can be found on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mclemcrew/MixologyDB) and will be available 12/05/23.

You will find two tools in this repo:
- Rotary Calculator
- Web Form

The rotary calculator was used to create a systematic way of evaluating parameter values on plugins that are not visable or otherwise accessible.

The web form was created for ease of use in annotating the tracks within the session files and to adhere to a consistent format for gathering these data.
