  "Great mix, but it bothers me a bit in the vocals, something in the low-mid. Otherwise, very well done. In terms of effects and spatiality, this is really good. In my opinion, the drums could be a bit more present.",
  "Not the best but certainly not bad.",
  "The vocals come in quite abruptly during the chorus but are better in terms of balance. Reverb on the snare sounds nice. This mix sounds more open than mix 1 and 4 and is better in terms of balance. Toms are well balanced compared to the rest of the drums.",
  "Mix sounds right. Nice spatial image but the snare is a bit small. Sounds quite distant.",
  "I would personally use less reverb, and especially a different patch. It could also use a bit more brightness and less muddiness; it doesn't necessarily sound open.",
  "The vocals have good effects but are slightly too loud at some moments. The EQ on the vocals is also well done. Maybe add a bit more compression on the vocals. The song itself lacks a bit of power. Drums are also relatively quiet.",
  "-The vocals sit well in the mix, but there seems to be a very dull delay on the lead, and it doesn't sound good. -Instruments in this mix seem heavily EQ'd just to cut through the mix, but they don't sound pleasant. I miss definition. -The chorus has a strange balance, it's almost only drums, vocals, and keys, while there is much more in it.",
  "0",
  "Nice but some panning should be added to all the instruments (very similar to track 3)",
  "A bit too much reverb for my taste. Quite punchy and clear mix though. Vocals dominate too much over the instruments. Good build up to the chorus which sounds more energetic than the verse as it should be. A bit more guitar would be welcome.",
  "good, but compared to others less rich . voice very over the rest",
  "Hard to make out the lyrics. Vocals should be louder. Nice balance otherwise",
  "there is a high cut here but I can't pin point the main characteristic of this mix. In the beginning vocals are not very well mixed but it gets better in the second section of the mix. Fair mix but lacks excitement",
  "Background vocals very prominent, Vocals overall a bit too prominent in comparison to remaining instruments. A very interesting mix",
  "Very cool mix, sounds lively and clean, maybe a bit too clean. I also miss the organ that plays a few notes here and there. The drums have a lot of punch, in my opinion, maybe too much for this type of music, but that's subjective. Overall, well done.",
  "The guitars are quite loud compared to the vocals. Otherwise, the balance is okay.",
  "Nice balance and stereo image. Sometimes, there's a bit too much effects on the vocals in my opinion. If that were toned down a bit, the vocals would come forward more in the mix.",
  "The mix derives its atmosphere from the delay on the vocals, providing an interesting spatial quality. The transition from verse to chorus works very well. Because the cymbals are mixed so loudly, they tend to smear a bit at times, which is unfortunate for the overall impact. In mono, the mix retains almost its full strength, but it becomes noticeable that the vocals are still somewhat uncontrolled.",
  "Lot of bass; live feel, not much vocal/clear; Overall louder! Strange reverb (too long?), Bass slightly too loud. Energy comes across well.",
  "In this chorus, I hear a guitar that I almost don't hear in the other mixes. Drum and bass carry the song quite well, better than the rest. Guitar sounds cool. The vocals, in my opinion, are just not compressed well enough. This chorus is the best.",
  "Perhaps the vocals are a bit too quiet, and there's a slight excess of reverb. It sounds very expansive, but I wonder if it might be a bit too much at times. The cymbals sound really washy. There might also be a bit too much hi-hat in this mix. The low end doesn't sound 100% tight to my ears.",
  "The mix is good. The proportions are okay, and the song sounds present. The effect on the vocals also suits the song well. Perhaps a bit too much guitar during the verses.",
  "-Sounds good! The drums have impact, there's enough low-mid (a problem in many). -Balance is good. -The slapback delay on the lead doesn't work 100%.",
  "0",
  "Nice but some panning should be added to all the instruments",
  "Similar to track 1. Reverb on vocals help to bed the track together. However sometime vocals get too quiet and cannot hear some lyrics. Drums are nice and punchy.",
  "it seems good, live room effect maybe too much. I like the guitar",
  "very similar to 6 but the voice has a higher energy and presence. Looks like it does not have enough gain",
  "I think there is a little much rev on the vocals at points, so maybe some automation or even a compressor? - the reverb isn't quite right. but the overall balance is nice",
  "Light and very roomy sound, washes out the details a bit",
  "Tight drums + bass. The guitars are nicely placed around that. The vocals might have a bit too much effect for this sound. I could, however, agree with the mix and balance.",
  "Much vocals and effects.",
  "This mix relies entirely on the atmospheric verses with the delay and vocals, but in the choruses, you expect more tangible elements. The guitars, in particular, are placed so quietly that the energy and harmonic information are lacking. In mono, the overall atmosphere is retained due to the delay on the vocals, but the mix loses some of its strength, especially highlighting the lack of bass and guitars.",
  "In this mix, there's quite a lot of vocals, and they're quite loud. I sometimes miss some guitar. The tambourine is quite loud compared to the rest of the drums. I miss energy in the drums and the whole song. It doesn't come together well in my opinion. I like the sound of the little guitar in the chorus. I appreciate that the vocals are not too dry, but it's a bit too much.",
  "Maybe a bit too much vocals. Guitars fade away towards the chorus. Quite a bit of reverb (too large space). Sound is good though.",
  "The snare has a better placement in the mix, blending more with the rest of the drum kit. Better pulse that also supports the vocals more.",
  "The vocals stand out quite a bit. The balance between the instruments is okay, but the vocals really hover over everything. Sounds super live.",
  "Lack of low-mid. The guitars lose their body because of this. These guitars almost sound like DI signals, also filtered a bit too much between 2-5kHz? -This mix fills the frequency spectrum better in the low and high compared to the low-mid. -Lots of delay! -Those keys in the chorus are actually a bit loud, but they sound pretty cool.",
  "0",
  "Balance between instrumental and vocals completely wrong. Vocals far too loud. Spatial balance good though. Nice sense of space",
  "really impressive echo and reverberate effect on this track, but i think it too much",
  "Nice mix, the vocals still feel a bit too dry to me; they could use more space. That way, they would fit better with the spatial sound of the instruments.",
  "A very direct mix. I'd add some effects; I find the vocals too upfront in the mix, especially during the harmonies.",
  "With the exception of the vocals, which could be more controlled in their dynamics, the mix sounds very musical and powerful. The reverb on the snare is a bit large/long for the song. It's a pity that more spatial effects aren't used in the choruses (delay on the vocals?). In mono, the mix retains almost its full strength, but it becomes noticeable that the vocals are still somewhat uncontrolled.",
  "This mix has a lot of energy for me. Drums (especially snare) might be a bit too loud, making the rest less audible. I miss the little guitar in the chorus; that's quite important. Vocals are too quiet in the beginning. Besides the snare being too loud, the mix is quite well balanced. Vocals are well balanced with each other. Apart from the snare being too loud, I find this mix quite successful. Guitar should be a bit louder in the chorus. This mix is louder and more open than the others.",
  "Drums are much more upfront. Due to this, I pay less attention to the vocals. The vocals being louder in the chorus helps, though.",
  "I'm a fan of this balance. This mix might sound a bit dry; the song sounds quite powerful with some reverb, but overall, it's mixed quite tightly. Perhaps a tad brighter in general.",
  "-Vocals stand a bit above in the verses. -Drums are sometimes a bit filtered in the low end; the snare loses some impact. -Bass is a bit loud but sounds good (that's something). -In the chorus, the guitars suddenly fall back; they sit better in the verses. It makes the chorus sound somewhat empty. -Overall, a good mix.",
  "0",
  "We discover things we can't hear on other mixes. Good presence and punchiness. Bass drum a bit too boomy. A bit \"in your face\" but fits well the style. Better use of panning than other mixes. I like the guitar pads on the sides. Vocals should be a bit louder on the verses especially in the quiet parts. Really good chorus. Like the effect on the vocals in the chorus.",
  "Punchy track. Very nice in chorus. Well balanced. Guitars need to be stronger. Drums are tinny. Everything coming from centre apart from spaced guitars, sounds dead at times when guitars get lost.",
  "good, bass bit too much",
  "is like the improved version of 4, with a bit more gain and levels more balanced",
  "i like this. Clearer voice but not getting over the rest of the tracks",
  "Most visibly the \"heaviest\" mix of all. More prominent kicks but not so visible on the Bass so not a complete EQ on overall mix but on the drums particularly. Vocals could be louder here but otherwise a fair balanced mix",
  "the vocal sound is quite prominent in this soundscape",
  "It sounds very nasal, a bit strange; it could be related to the monitoring method during the mix (earphones, headphones, monitors, ...). In terms of balance, it's nice, but still a bit dry.",
  "The balance is okay, but the guitars and vocals are a bit too much on top of each other. There's a lot happening in the 800-2.5k range.",
  "Completely different mix, guitar clearly upfront. Kind of a singer-songwriter approach. The shaker also gives a vibe reminiscent of a 1960s production.",
  "-Lack of highs, lack of lows. -The drums are really out of place, they are too quiet. -Guitars are too loud in the verses. -Balance is better in the choruses. Overall, this mix is quite okay.",
  "0",
  "The vocals and actually everything is too narrow (EQ). Guitars too loud. Not bad chorus though. Good presence. Panning could be a bit more used to spread things a bit more.",
  "Overall very middy. Lacking bass and highs. Guitars are nice. Drums have no energy at all, no kick and snare is muted. Vocals very dry and stand out, though don't bed well.",
  "The whole mix sounds very lo-fi, as if it was played over an old telephone or a radio. Otherwise the instruments are relatively well balanced",
  "Guitars are low, nice high end overall. Maybe the best mix, but just because you cannot hear the bad overdriven guitars",
  "Good but the guitar is too present and not well panned in my opinion",
  "Good width with the panning. Too much drums with exaggerated reverb, like it's being played in a stadium. Vocals are too thin. Doesn't sound natural. It's the FM sound.",
  "interesting use of space, bit flat in the front",
  "What I usually achieve by setting the EQ to \"rock\" on a hifi system. Heavy low and high frequencies. The amount of high frequencies are more that I like. Guitar seems stereo. Overall a fair/good mix but would be tiring to listen to more than a few minutes and it lacks too much mid frequencies. This is noticeable towards the end where the keys come in",
  "the balance is ok , but I do not like it",
  "This one is also ok but I feel 0 is more balanced",
  "Attenuated high frequencies on vocals are the most prominent feature here. Everything else seems quite well balanced but this EQ is making the mix dirty and therefore it's not a desirable effect. Fair mix",
  "This has a bit more character than the others, perhaps thanks to the guitar",
  "The best of the four mixes, good balance of the drums, good balance between guitars and bass. Lack of vocal presence in the choruses (gain automation in that part).",
  "The vocals could be more present. The drums have a good balance, and the keys also fit well in the mix.",
  "Best of the lot. The vocal seems ok. The cymbals need to be less bright. The bass is also not good.",
  "Elements overly compressed. Difficulty hearing the drums. Good presence of vocals and bass. There is an excess of reverb and gate that makes the snare sound very mechanical. Good use of pans on the drum toms, but lacking in low end and presence of overheads.",
  "Saturation on the vocals suits the genre but could still have a bit more air. Guitar could use a bit more brightness.",
  "Quite balanced where the guitars are mixed well, bass too. The snare could have more mid-lows to give it more body.",
  "Good mix, but the vocals needed more attention to not get lost in some parts of the mix.",
  "It has better definition in the guitar, but the rest seems very confusing/muffled.",
  "The volume of the vocals is high in relation to the instrumental, especially in the choruses with effects. The choice of vocal effect makes it distant from the rest of the band and in a different space. Another element that stands out excessively is the tambourine. The mix has a lot of information in the center, causing the guitar and bass lines to sometimes become confusing. Overall, the low-end seems a bit high and the highs low, causing little definition in the sound. All instruments seem to be dynamically controlled without losing their timbre. Overall, if the volumes were better balanced, the entire mix would improve.",
  "- The base guitar could be higher, as well as the solo - Good drums mix - Vocals too high",
  "In terms of volumes, everything seems fine. The guitars are in tremendous confusion (in the solo, there is a greater perception).",
  "Compressed drums create a heavier and more stable tone in the music. However, it makes the mix sound more pop, \"which may not be the best solution to differentiate it from other songs.\"",
  "- Drums could be higher (especially the snare drum) - Missing some power to the bass (maybe more volume and a little distortion) - Good guitar mix (base/solo)",
  "The volume between instruments is balanced, with the vocals and solo guitar slightly above the snare. There is a good use of stereo imaging, providing a nice separation between instruments and their various timbres. However, some effects on the vocals make them confusing. It seems that the use of compression/limiting/saturation was exaggerated. This processing caused the drums, especially the snare and cymbals, to lose some characteristics. The use of reverbs and short delays contributes to making the mix larger and more immersive. However, as the mid-low range is too filled, attention is diverted to the bass and snare, making the sound less defined and clear. Overall, less compression and better cleaning of the mid-range would help improve the overall sound.",
  "This mix has greater definition than some. The vocals are very muffled. It is more open than the others in a positive sense.",
  "The voice is very distant when the accompaniment comes in. Compression makes the mix more audible. The percussion is well done.",
  "- Great drums mix - Solo guitar could be higher - Good vocals mix (good use of reverb)",
  "Within the not so pleasant mixes I just heard, this one seemed to be the best. Despite the low volume of the drums, there is a good relationship between the drums and the bass. The vocals need treatment. The guitars need more emphasis.",
  "The definition of the vocals is slightly better than the others.",
  "The guitars sound good, and there is a well-balanced volume. However, the vocals sometimes exhibit effects that I didn't like to hear. The guitar solo is quite hidden.",
  "- Good drum mix (dry snare) - Base guitar too low - Bass too low",
  "The vocals sound even more radio-like, but it's not to my liking at all. Too much indistinctiveness and too many high frequencies. Backing vocals don't fit well with the main vocals. However, the mix of instruments is pleasant. I would like to hear a bit more snare drum.",
  "Missing low frequencies! The overall equalization is really bizarre; there was no openness; however, this mix takes this song in a new direction, very interesting. The vocals are very well done, as well as the drums. The guitar sounds very good.",
  "Among the mixes, this one was my favorite. I think the vocals are better related/balanced with the rest of the instrumentation.",
  "The vocals stand out slightly from the other instruments. Timbrically, the low-end seems a bit exaggerated, and the mid-range is a bit muddled. The use of effects in this mix is the one that works best because it opens up all the instruments in the stereo image without losing their clarity.",
  "The vocals have an interesting definition. I'm not very fond of the back vocals. The rest of the instruments are overly compressed (in terms of sensation). I miss a slightly more prominent snare drum.",
  "Soloist's voice well done (reverb and equalization); the accompaniment of the voice is well done; the chorus could be stronger. The guitar sounds good but could be slightly more prominent. The dirty drums are cool.",
  "- Good final mix (between vocals and the other instruments) - Bass guitar is well balanced, as well as the Guitar - Missing some reverb to the backvocals",
  "The volume between instruments is well balanced, with snare and vocals being more prominent. Timbrically, the standout is the poorly defined and muddled snare sound. The vocals also seem to be excessively equalized. However, the distortion used in the vocals works well with this style of music. The reverb and delay effects are moderate and enhance the mix. Overall, the timbre of the mix is not well controlled, lacking definition and brightness.",
  "I don't like the vocals, too thin, too much effort to sound radio-like. The mix of instruments is quite balanced. I like the subtlety of the backing vocals.",
  "Nice panoramic opening; bizarre vocal processing; well-done vocal accompaniment; reasonable chorus. Too much present bass.",
  "- Good final mix (between vocals and the other instruments) - Bass could be powerfull - Guitar could be higher - Vocals too much on the right",
  "Enjoyed the split guitar on L and R. However, I find it too loud in relation to the rest of the instrumentation.",
  "In general, the volume of all instruments is well balanced. I notice only that the guitar is sometimes slightly louder than the rest of the instruments, and the snare is relatively low. Timbrically, the drums lack presence, and the guitar is making the mix sound average and muddled. The use of reverbs and delays worked well, providing depth and space to the mix. The vocals seem to be filtered excessively.",
  "- Drums could be higher - Guitar too much on the left - Good vocals mix (nice reverb) - Good back vocals mix - Bass could be powerfull",
  "A well-balanced mix, but everything sounds a bit muffled. I like the chorus, though.",
  "The chorus is very well done. Strong bass. The beginning went very well. Lacks presence in the mids: the guitar is too invisible (as is the drum).",
  "- Kick Drum too high (compared to the rest) - Hi Hats too low - Good Guitar and Bass Guitar mix - Good vocals and back vocals mix",
  "More balanced mix, however, the bass should be equalized to be more defined.",
  "The vocals are too boxy, this eq is bad! The back vocals/choir seem ok. The drums need more brightness. Tamborine should be a panned (in my opinion). Guitars seem ok.",
  "It seems to me that the choice to set the vocals apart was good, but a bit exaggerated. The bass is good, and the guitars too. The drums could have the kick more present.",
  "0",
  "vocal could use more clarity versus the keys. also, more compression once the chorus hits, her voice sticks out too far. otherwise cool! nice rhythm section. not a big fan of the vocal delay/verb personally.",

  "Pretty nice, but bit too much reverb, and reproduction quality isn't excellent",

  "Guitar loses impact due to compression, but creates a nice subtle mix.",
  "Instrumentals lack impact. Quite a lot of reverb on vocals, but this give the mix warmth.",
  "Good depth of the voice. I noticed the guitar with this mix. It needs more presence of the rhythmic structure. Compared to the others, there are things missing.",
  "Drums too dry. Nice vocal (but too low). I like the low mid-punch from the kick/bass, but itsa bit too much",
  "drums veiled (more highs), kik a little too forward, snr dark, in general good balance could be brighter - esp vocal to cut",
  "strong kick but the snare is too dark. lead vocals could use more ambience. bg vox cool",
  "If you can clean up the low end mud, then this would be a better mix. Kick and snare are really overpowering the song, esp in the chorus.",

  "Cool vocal sound - would've switched to regular sound on chorus, kik needs definition",
  "The theory of vocal reverb is cool, but it doesn't make sense with the rest of the mix. Also, the guitar and the keyboard are much too loud. They are really taking over the mix. Really the whole mix is imbalanced.",
  "creative mix on the vox, drums sit nice, elec guitar is a little too present",

  "Less mid frequency but vocals could be dealt like this in some cases.",
  "the effect on the vocal is nice. would have fit better with more seperation of the other sources. its a nice idea but could have been executed better. the right channel has the loud guitar which become annoying after a wile",
  "Dry mix, no depth. Vocal is too loud, the rest is pretty good. Where is the reverb? Come on, a bit won't hurt anyone. Oh god, the vocal needs it!",
  "like the fullness of the mix. vocals could come up a hair, and with a different EQ & a bit of verb support it'd take 1st.",

  "pretty good Bass and Kick where's the verb on LD V? LD V not mixed where's the perspective between LD and LD BG in C2??",
  "I like the dryness, but the vocal needs a little bit of verb. Levels OK, but vocal needs riding. Back vocals unbalanced. DRUMS STILL BOXY.",
  "Too dry. Mostly just the drums need calming down, the snare cracks through too much. Maybe better with some reverb. When vocals are not present it is just dead. However during the chorus the energy swells nicely.",
  "Looks like the track 2.",
  "Nice mix. Vocals could be put a bit more to the front. The instrumentation is almost dominating the vocals.",
  "Less low frequency may be better.",
  "Really like interplay of back vocals and vocals and how they mesh and move differently depending on their role in the arrangement, and the words. Vocals are warm.",
  "Needs less high/mid end on drums. In general good dynamic balance between instruments and good. Good equalisation. Could do with more reverb.",
  "Background vox WAAY too low. Drums too roomy. Where is the guitar? Where are the Keys? Lead vocal, bass, and drum room does not a mix make. Good snare volume.",
  "good balance, too much reverb, response vocals don't blend in.",
  "lots o voc reverb...voc way too far out front. kick too roomy needs more kick and less OHs. bass light. bg vocs too soft. snare good",
  "The bass could use some more presence.",
  "Quite strong. Reverbs used are good. Instrumentals and little hooks and guitar rifts should be emphasised more to fill those little gaps. Backing vocals are far to quiet.",
  "Clear sound with reverb.",
  "Drums have a lot of punch. Levels are good. Possibly a little too much reverb.",
  "same as track 2",
  "Too much reverb and drums are too high in mix although this could be down to preference. Conversely, sense of expanse is nice.",
  "Less snare verb. More background vocals. Nice low end. Vocal sounds dull",
  "Nice snare, good verb. Maybe a bit much on the snare? BG could come up. and don't need to be fully spread L to R",
  "oo big snare reverb - cool. voc good, bg voc too dry and low in places. mostly good balances",
  "N/A",
  "Very nice. Drums slightly too wet?",
  "there's a curtain, interesting tones of the bass",
  "they seeem similar to 6 3 and 7",
  "Reverbs on vocals and guitar are way too long! Distracting. Mix is a bit bright. Generally ok balances.",
  "Lots of verb, maybe a bit much...Nice bass and kick",
  "too much predelay on main vocals, nice balance",
  "The use of the reverb at the beginning of the track is very interesting, it would be interesting to hear the section immediately before to better understand if this is actually great. The mix is not very convincing otherwise. A bit too much reverb",
  "Guitar's are nicely balanced. Drums are clear but not overly heavy (snare could again calm down a bit more) but the reverb here works to fill the gaps between the beats. Vocal reverb too strong some-times, some automation or input compression to reduce reverb strength in load parts.",
  "Similar to 0 but a bit clearer voice",
  "vocals too thin and present, but overall nice eq but a little too much space",
  "same as track1",
  "A little too much reverb and vocals are a little too high in mix. Apart from this everything is good.",
  "Little less rhythm guitars. More vocal, and more verb on vocal. This has the most bass, I like that.",
  "GTR verb is over done. Good snare. not enough kick at all. good GTR levels and freq balance. Lead vox too harshly compressed.",
  "voc lost at top. bass is hot. drums good. voc dry. bg vocs could be louder",
  "pretty good mix, too much rev on Slide EGtr. mistaken mix between Chorus EGtr and Slide",
  "Decent EQ, but snare has no life. Panning pretty good. Guitars too compressed and quiet. Chorus weak, need more sustained instruments.",
  "Full sound and wide stereo field. Slide sticks out a little.",
  "In the first verse lead voice has not enough presence. However, now the balance between the lead voice and the slide is good. I like how the choirs sit in the back in part C and the mix between the dry lead voice and the same line with chorus in part B is pleasing. In general, I like how the effects (reverb and chorus) have been used in the mix. Bass too loud.",
  "Less clicky kick. Guitars could be turned down to give more room for drums.",
  "Kick is weirdly clicky. Needs more body and needs to sound more like a kick drum. Not very intersting - could use more shaping of the mix. But reasonable balances. Bass is a little light.",
  "Drums too compressed. You can hear them pumping. Good rhythm guitars, vocal placement.",
  "good mix, kick has nice attack but lacking of the low end, good dynamic change in chorus. guitars are good but I could use slightly more low end to give them more weight.",
  "Separating the guitar doubling is great! Adds huge amount of depth. Drum reverb is well timed as well, but watch for pumping on the compressor, makes it more like a gunshot. Also keep the reverb during the chorus build-up where the drums are the focus point.",
  "Full sound, nice reverb on vocals - sharp kit. lacking in LF.",
  "vocals a bit loud, strange EQ, but good",
  "Plain. Reverb adjustment for the voice is better than track 2 for my taste.",
  "The live feeling is very strong.",
  "this mix is better.",
  "Plentiful mix. However, the vocality is a bit weaken. The rhythm of the drum-kit is good. Especially the fluctuation.",
  "balance is ok, compression is a bit heavy on the drums, sounds very small when the band gets louder",
  "Lead vocal is too dry compared to the rest of the band. Snare a little quiet. Fairly good balance overall.",
  "Slide a bit loud. Good kick / snare. Drums need to come up during chorus. Stays flat...",
  "voc too loud, and up and down. good snare. good bass. wimpy tambourine",
  "Decent drum sound, I like the vocal but too dry. Guitars too set back. Slide gtr needs verb or something.",
  "Really nice use of stereo field. Lead vox a little dry?",
  "Vocals sound too close. Very similar to track 2, but a little more central. Vocals are just too dry. Same comment as track 6, needs to be stadium filling! Energy is just dumped going into the chorus, then the vocals are way too strong during the chorus. Shame as the verse is pretty good.",
  "nice stereo image. Clean low end, but low notes on the bass don't come out as much as they could.",
  "Missing some top end. Good separation of backing vocals.",
  "I prefer this one to track 0. More clear dynamics, choir panning corrected. Still hard to differentiate the slide guitar. Part A is dry compared to track 5, but part C is better.",
  "voc good. kick needs more point, bass is dark. bd voc too hot",
  "good warm drum / bass / egtr mix lead vocal not integrated; B-Sect & Chorus BG vocals unconvincing. Chorus BG's a big, big mistake",
  "So much slide guitar through the verses... Turn it down, but then bring back up for soli/fill licks.",
  "Softer sound but feels natural and well balanced",
  "Good drums. Good vocals. Good lead guitar fills and rhythm guitar levels. Chorus hits hard, fucken eh! Easy on the tambo there tho",
  "Good pop on snare, but perhaps a little much. wide imaging. widest mix? best drums and snare.",
  "Nice snare. Lead vocal is peaky freq-wise - sounds nasty. GTRs not loud enough in chorus.",
  "Snare reverb a little long for the mix, may be too wet. nice vocal",
  "vocals seem too forward, doesnt connect with rest of band. good drums but too much verb on the snare. overall good balances.",
  "like the drums. bass is dark. voc very hot,but good... good mix",
  "good drum presence; nice rev on snare good Slide EGtr position, level main EGtr's not big enough Lead vocal not quite integrated in track",
  "Good snare! Strong drums overall, but kick a bit pointy.",
  "Nicely balanced but lacking some power",
  "Drum reverb is perfectly timed, but could use more energy. Same as track 3, keep the reverb in for the fill into the chorus. Something like Red Hot Chilli Peppers!!",
  "I like it also at high volume",
  "Stronger mix effect.",
  "Lots of envelopment in comparison. reverb heaven. drums could be more defined",
  "very reverberant overall, maybe too much, drums sounds small compared to the guitars. don't hear the keyboard in the mix, nice balancce between backing vocal and lead vocal",
  "Good drum sound, maybe a bit too quiet. Right guitar louder than left...a bit distractions. prechorus is good.",
  "too much reverb on guitars. The idea is good but too much or maybe too long reverb. Is it a jazz drummer palying?? no punch. Vocals a bit forward.",
  "voc bathed in funny reverb. guitars floating abit in processing. good kick. snare needs more core",
  "Nice wide mix, slightly too much reverb?",
  "The whole sound track goes to the right.",
  "Bring out lead guitar fills, not so verby and shitty sounding. Why don't you like kick drums? Brett played it so well, stop hating it! Less background vocals.",
  "Round mix. Lots of 200-500Hz",
  "Good mix, but needs drums up and more bass. Basically it sounds \"safe\"...Thinking if it had a bit more ooomf in the lows it would be great.",
  "Nice stereo image, needs a little more snap on the snare and punch on drums",
  "good energy overall. guitars are nice but take too much place maybe? back vocals too loud sometimes. need more drums, snare sound weak.",
  "Need more kick. guitars nice. Slide guitar too loud, covering vocal. Back vocals too much. Not horrible balances.",
  "Verse is so strong! Guitars placed brilliantly with good reverb. Vocals are not stable, continuously changing in volume and at some points it is a real struggle to hear. Going into the chorus, the energy is dropped as the drums are just not strong enough. Chorus starts off well but the backing vocals are stronger than the lead",
  "Nice balance /separation of guitars. Lead vocals a bit low in mix",
  "There is something off with the slide guitar, maybe too much reverb compared with the rest in part A, so it does not mix quite right. The choir in part C is too loud too. However I liked part B a lot in this one, the mix between dry and 'chorused' voice is perfect, and the instrument with chorus in the back (guitar or organ) sounds better than in any of the other tracks.",
  "It is not very suitable in the concert. Too much compressed. The main melody is good.",
  "left guitar is too loud and sticks out, interesting effect for the chorus vocal, nice snare drum, could use more bass, overall could use more reverb",
  "This is good. Lead vocal is perhaps too midrangy.",
  "Lead guitar conflicts with the vocals sometimes. Kick and snare are a nice level. Overall very good. Full sound.",
  "voc bright/nasal but good level?. bass dark? chorus balances good",
  "Vocals are wonderfully crisp. Everything sounds big and rocky. Interesting vocal effects before the chorus, but if you are going to do something like this also add space, having phasor central just sounds weird. Guitar doubling is great. Snare is good but rest of the kit just lost (is it just a snare and micro hi-hat).",
  "'lead' guitare is a bit loud, and takes too much space off the lead vocals. Good vocals presence. This rhythm section sounds a bit thin.",
  "weak compared to others, but kind of well weighted. the singer seems to 'spit' too much in front.",
  "where has the Bass gone! Sharp vocals, but vocal effect is unnecessary. Too much compression, percussion disappears... nice space",
  "Nice stereo spread. Vocals a little nasaly.",
  "There is a part interesting during the middle of track 7. Some special design in this track. But the voice of the singer is a bit isolated, not touching.",
  "The hi-hat feels a bit too prominent to me; it stands out quite a bit. Nice bass sound, definitely. Overall, a cool mix!",
  "What first catches my attention is the guitar on the left in the mix. It seems like it has a lot of noise, giving me the feeling that something is interfering. Everything else is well audible. I find the balance between guitars and vocals pleasant. However, in the midrange, there's an annoying frequency around 3.15Hz, making it sound aggressive.",
  "Overall, a lot of transparency and a wide mix. Not much low-end in the mix. The bass notes are audible but lack body.",
  "This mix relies heavily on the snare and bass, somewhat succeeding in creating an atmospheric feeling. From a mixing perspective, it's a very bright mix. In mono, it loses much of its strength. However, the atmosphere and depth work well at times, reminiscent of an Echo And The Bunnymen production from the 1980s.",
  "Hi-hat is quite loud compared to the rest of the drums. I don't like the sound of the snare (it's a bit too snappy), and I miss some kick. The vocals sit well in the mix. Bass could be a bit quieter or the guitar a bit louder, but this is a detail. I find this mix okay.",
  "The song sounds clear, but perhaps a bit too bright, making it sound a bit harsh. There's a lack of kick, and there's too much hi-hat in the drums. However, the proportions and the overall atmosphere are good.",
  "- Bass has a bit too much sub, and it's a bit too loud. - Vocals are somewhat aggressive in the 2-5kHz range and lack highs in other areas. - Balance is pretty good. The mix sounds a bit dirty overall, especially the vocals sounding strange in the highs with a lot of s, t, and p sounds.",
  "0",
  "normal",
  "It seems the best mix",
  "Too thin and airy. Good cohesion otherwise.",
  "Too bright. Vocals fatiguing to listen to and the tambourine. Rest of the song very muddy though, which is very distracting when the vocals not present. Disjointed. But good energy throughout.",
  "Not bad, but vivid sound.",
  "Most 'pop music' mix-wise.",
  "In the low-mid, there seems to be something that lingers and is a bit distracting. Can't immediately identify the source, could it be an acoustic guitar? Otherwise, the mix sounds very spacious, definitely a cool mix. The hi-hat might be a bit imbalanced compared to the rest of the drums.",
  "Finally, a song with bass. Yes, there is indeed too much bass. The combination of bass and bass drum is indistinguishable. However, I find the overall balance between guitar and vocals in this song good.",
  "Too much low end in the bass, sound-wise it's okay, but maybe apply it more subtly. The balance is alright, but there isn't really a sense of depth created; everything is quite close together.",
  "A clear mix with prominent vocals, although it's generally scooped in the mid. This shifts the balance towards the sub. The spatiality works very well and gives air to the whole mix. In mono, the mix somewhat retains its strength, but it's noticeable that the rhythm guitar is not well-balanced.",
  "There's something disturbing in the low end of this mix. I find this very distracting. Snare sounds thin. Vocals sit well in the mix, but the guitar could be a bit louder and cut through more at times.",
  "The bass has too much sub. The drums are relatively soft. The vocals sound good but could use a bit more compression and be a bit brighter. Too much hi-hat in the drums. Guitars sound good but could perhaps come forward a bit more (brighter/less reverb).",
  "- The sub-bass from the bass is unbelievably loud. Everything else is pushed away in comparison; it's hard to provide feedback. As far as I can hear, the rest of the mix is okay. - Reverb on the drums is nice. - The loudest part of the drum here is the hi-hat, which is unusual.",
  "0",
  "normal",
  "Similar to track 3 but more energy throughout. Feels more produced than track 3. Chorus gets a bit messy but the balance throughout is quite nice. Drums too muted and dull, get so lost in the chorus that there is just a sudden drop in energy at the wrong place.",
  "lacks mids and too much bass for the style, but ok atmosphere and vocals nice",
  "Enhance the deep bass.",
  "The BGM of this mixing is not well-arranged at the beginning but when gradually entering its own rhythm, it sounds better.",
  "better",
  "The bass drum sound is not really my thing, and there is also no connection between the bass and the bass drum; they don't blend very precisely. However, it's cool that the drums are more prominent in the mix here. The percussion is also clearly present, definitely a plus!",
  "A very neat mix. It shows a good understanding of the genre. There isn't an excessive amount of highs or lows. The balance between guitars and vocals is well done. Sufficient space has been left for instruments in this mix.",
  "The mix has a very wide stereo image. The vocals sit nicely in the mix. The drum and bass are well balanced. Perhaps bring the guitars slightly more to the forefront.",
  "A lot of bass. The vocals could have been a bit more pronounced.",
  "Due to the emphasis on high-frequency elements, this mix lacks mid-range information, making the overall sound weak. The placement of the bass works well but has a lot of room since all guitars are somewhat undermixed. A mix that relies more on suggestion than concrete information.",
  "I miss a bit of bass. I find the kick quite good in this mix; it has more attack. Maybe add a bit more guitar occasionally; I miss that too. Otherwise, I find this okay.",
  "Quite empty in the mid-range. The individual instruments sound okay, but I think maybe a bit more electric guitar could be added. The bass is also quite loud in the very low frequencies.",
  "Something is missing in the song. It seems like a part of the filling is missing. The bass guitar and drums are good. More guitars could be added. The song sounds quite clear and pleasant.",
  "- Again, too much sub-bass in the bass. - Guitars sound pretty cool. Acoustic guitar is too loud and doesn't contribute much to this song. The rest of the guitars are a bit quiet compared to it. - Nice atmosphere, drums are a bit on the loud side, but fortunately, they sound good, especially the snare",
  "Best mix overall",
  "0",
  "normal",
  "Punchy, good drum and bass sound. We can hear the acoustic guitar (e.g. hidden in a lot of other mixes). Need more cohesion between the acoustic and electric guitars. A bit less hi-hat. Good width.",
  "Vocals feel muted and muddy, some clarity missing, more highs needed. Guitars feel nice. Drums are punchy and clean, but sometimes need more power to drive the song.",
  "Bass is nice and defined in this one. More panning needed",
  "expect singer voice got some special effect to mix the music better",
  "One of the guitars sounds a bit nasal here, which immediately makes the mix a bit restless. In my opinion, the vocals could also be a bit more prominent in the mix. I also mix in some bass; it's very deep under the mix.",
  "A lot of guitar. I miss the piano a bit.",
  "A straightforward rock mix that sounds wide in stereo due to the placement of the guitars but loses almost all its atmosphere in mono. This indicates a mix where the elements are not fully balanced. The bass is static compared to the rest of the rhythm section. The 'lo-fi' approach to the drums sounds refreshing, but the kick is too messy in its EQ to provide enough power to the foundation.",
  "This could use a bit more brightness and wideness. The guitar seems a bit loud and sounds bad, taking up a lot of space with those resonances. Other mixes that sound better here have less guitar and more highs. The drums are cool though.",
  "The mix sounds clean, but perhaps a bit too empty as a result. Guitars sound good but could use a bit more effects to fill it out. The guitars are also a bit too loud. There's a lack of effect/EQ on the snare. The bass guitar could come through a bit louder.",
  "-Your guitars are a bit strange. (I think guitar amp + room signal are panned left and right.) You have one guitar that sounds loud, and the rest hangs under it. -Drums sound pretty good; the kick might be a bit loud, but it's not really bothering. It propels the song a bit. -The mix sounds extremely empty.",
  "0",
  "normal",
  "Nice but some panning should be added to all the instruments",
  "Good cohesion. Punchy. Acoustic guitar disappeared but it works well simply with the electric one (creative choice). Instruments dominate a bit the vocals.",
  "Guitars not strong enough to support the vocals. Drums quite nice but not balanced well with the bass guitar. Some odd notes are prominent on the bass but not others, quite distracting. Vocals nice and controlled. Guitars too loud",
  "too much prominence of bass, but lively. Voice quiet but everything clear. boxy drums.",
  "The guitar really shines through on this one nicely. Vocal could maybe be higher",
  "Compared to the other songs, it's a track with a lot of midrange. The guitars dominate the overall mix. It's fatiguing to the ears. However, this is the first song where I hear a slight slap-back delay, which isn't bad.",
  "A mix that, due to its balance choices, feels very natural and almost reminiscent of a Neil Young production. The choice of (stereo) delay on the vocals is very interesting but is not always well-controlled, making it sometimes disruptive. The kick is more suggested than pronounced, but this surprisingly works well in the overall context. In mono, the mix retains much of its strength, but the vocals sound very dry, compromising the atmosphere somewhat. The attitude in this mix is very good, thanks to the 'loud' guitars and direct approach. The mix sounds a bit nasal, but due to the good balance choices, this could be addressed in mastering.",
  "Here, too, the hi-hat is quite loud compared to the rest of the drums. The guitar comes through more here, but sometimes it stands out too much. The bass could be a bit louder compared to the guitar. The vocals sit quite well in the mix.",
  "There's a lot of mid-high in the overall song. The guitars and vocals seem to be in the same frequency range. The song could sound more open. The vocals sound reasonably good, so I think the issue might be with the guitars. Otherwise, the song is good.",
  "- A lot of sub-bass in the bass, which this song definitely doesn't need. - Vocals lack some clarity. - A lot of hi-hat, it really stands out above the rest of the drums. - The grittiness in those guitars sounds cool. - Nice atmosphere!",
  "0",
  "normal",
  "Very similar to track 5. However the vocals just miss some bedding in from the reverb in track 5. Sits on top of the mix during the chorus which really lets it down.",
  "Could have used more stereo space.",
  "normal",
  "all the sound is strong, so not mixed well.",
  "Snare is a bit polite, the rest of the mix is 6music worthy. Quite middle-y, but pleasant all the same.",
  "Rhythm sensation is ok but EQ seems not very good."
