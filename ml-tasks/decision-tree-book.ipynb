    "This notebook is a manifestation of a decision tree derived from the suggestions in the book.  There are numerous ways to heed the advice from the book and how to implement it and this is one attempt at doing so. There are two ways of handling how to do this, decision lists (ordered) and decision sets (unordered).  I will try to combine them in a way that makes sense in doing so, but please note that most of this will be within decision list format.\n",

    "| 16Hz to 60Hz Sub-Bass | Encompasses sounds that are often felt more than heard and gives the music a sense of power. | Too much emphasis in this range makes the music sound muddy. Attenuating this range (especially below 40 Hz) can clean up a mix considerably. |\n",
    "| 60Hz to 250Hz Bass | Contains fundamental notes of the rhythm section. | EQing this range can change the musical balance, making it fat or thin. Too much boost in this range can make the music sound boomy. |\n",
    "| 250Hz to 2kHz Low Mids | Contains the low-order harmonics of most musical instruments. | Can introduce a telephone-like quality to the music if boosted too much. Boosting the 500Hz to 1000Hz octave makes the instruments sound horn-like. Boosting the 1kHz to 2kHz octave makes them sound tinny. Excess output in this range can cause listening fatigue. |\n",
    "| 2kHz to 4kHz High Mids | Contains speech recognition sounds such as \"m,\" \"b,\" and \"v.\" | Too much boost in this range, especially at 3kHz, can introduce a lisping quality to a voice. Too much boost in this range can cause listening fatigue. Dipping the 3kHz range on instrument backgrounds and slightly peaking 3 kHz on vocals can make the vocals audible without having to decrease the instrument level in mixes where the voice would otherwise seem buried. |\n",
    "| 4kHz to 6kHz Presence | Responsible for clarity and definition of voices and instruments. | Boosting this range can make the music seem closer to the listener. Reducing the 5kHz content of a mix makes the sound more distant and transparent. |\n",
    "| 6kHz to 16kHz Brilliance | Controls brilliance and clarity. | Too much emphasis in this range can produce sibilance on the vocals. 10kHz and above provides \"air\" and sense of realism. |"
