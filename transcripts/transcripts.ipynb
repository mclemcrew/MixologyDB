      "Speaker SPEAKER_06: 3923.3s - 3935.9s\n",

      "Speaker SPEAKER_01: 3937.5s - 4001.6s\n",

      " and hearing someone talk,\n",
      " which I also get with music that could be a little bit\n",
      " 'cause you're like listening and then also hearing a voice.\n",
      " But I think at least having the option of something\n",
      " that would be able to talk to you would be nice.\n",

      " having it be able to highlight something,\n",

      " it would save a lot of time.\n",
      " Sort of like, I think one of the best examples\n",
      " I can think of right now is like the mastering assistant\n",
      " in Ozone.\n",
      " Really like it can detect frequencies very quickly\n",
      " and give you like a template to work with super quickly.\n",
      " And I find that that saves me so much time\n",
      " 'cause I can still make all the changes\n",
      " to make it sound how I want,\n",
