  "It's very disturbing that the backing track of the lead is running along. They are not in sync. In terms of balance, it's not a bad mix overall, but I just can't listen to it. It irritates me immensely.",
  "Too much drums/vocals, too few guitars, especially the melodic guitar.",
  "The mix lacks presence in the vocals. Due to the loud cymbals, you would expect the vocals to be EQed to sound 'fresher.' In mono, the mix loses some of its strength, and the uncontrolled vocals are particularly noticeable.",
  "The mix sounds quite empty. Perhaps make more room through EQ?",
  "vocals get lost in places",
  "Very narrow stereo width, vocals are too prominent",
  "barely can hear drums. voice it too present and not improved.",
  "Too much rev, where have the vocals gone?",
  "the voice stands a bit too much",
  "maybe the EQ balance affected and mixed all these sound sources together, not bad",
  "This lacks punch as well, although I find it better than the first two. The whole mix is not very loud and the guitar is not distinctive enough",
  "some delay effect",
  "Bit too much hi-hat/overheads.",
  "Hi-hat is louder than the rest of the drum kit, which is a bit bothersome to me. Again, the vocals seem to fade away a bit.",
  "Drums a bit too loud and vocals a bit too quiet in the verse",
  "Vocals are a bit too quiet, the bad sound of the guitar recording is very obvious here",
  "Punchy and clear mix but too much drums especially during intro of the verses. Not sure the selected reverb for the vocals fits the recording (too roomy). Panning could be better used to spread things more in the sound field.",
  "Vocals hard to hear. Weird reverb going on.",
  "This one is like a soup of tracks",
  "Distant vocals create a muffled effect and for a pop/rock track this is not a desirable outcome. Vocals should have been placed a lot more in \"front\". This makes it a poor mix but instruments seem quite balanced otherwise",
  "sounds like the vocal is far away from me, maybe it ought to increase the volume of the vocal part",
  "There is a bizarre reverb on this one, as if it was already played in a specific room. The instruments are covering the vocals too.",
  "drum is grate / some delay effect",
  "The vocals stand out significantly above the mix; they almost overshadow the guitars completely. In the chorus, everything fades away except for vocals and drums; the musical aspect almost disappears, which is a bit unfortunate.",
  "There is time invested in this mix, with a lot of effects and vocals pushing the rest to the background. Guitars are not audible at all. I find it to be a poor mix.",
  "Too much vocals, too little guitar, excessive effect during the choruses.",
  "Few guitars, a lot of vocals with not so pleasant EQ, but it sounds open. A gap in the low-mid.",
  "The vocals are too loud, and there's a lack of drums and bass, especially in the chorus. If the vocals were less loud, it would solve a lot.",
  "Mix sounds a bit thin.",
  "Where is the band? It is vocals only, in a pool of reverb",
  "The voice has too much reverber and it has a too much higher volume compared to the other instruments",
  "Too much reverb and the vocals are too predominant. Too much air/HF on the hi-hat which is too loud, tiring for the ears. Weird delay on the vocals in the chorus.",
  "dreamy, edgy at high, voice far too prominent and screaming - rough",
  "voice is too much present. it sounds much more than the instruments. moreover i can't barely listen the guitar. I can hear the echoes of the singer in the room",
  "Sounds like i solo'd the vocal reverb track...",
  "Too much reverb. Bass isn't very well defined. Neither is the kick.",
  "too much on the reverb",
  "Vocals are clearly too loud and the space design used here therefore seems too much too. Although it could be due to everything else being so quiet. The rest of the mix is being severely affected when vocals are in and even if they were mixed well vocals is affecting what we hear a lot negatively",
  "Vocals are too present compared to the instrumental behind",
  "Bit too bass-heavy, guitar barely audible, vocals seem to artificial",
  "vocal is harsh",
  "Vocals are quite dry in the mix and very transparent, maybe a bit too much in the foreground during the choruses.",
  "Too much kick/snare, vocals too quiet in the verse.",
  "Vocals are quite dry in reverb, a lot of high frequencies, energy comes across well.",
  "The vocals sound quite dull. More highs in the mix?",
  "The vocals lack some effects and are a bit too quiet in the verses compared to the chorus. The song sounds clear, and the proportions are right. The guitars might sound a bit too thin.",
  "Drums a bit too loud and vocals a bit too quiet in the verse",
  "Voice is too quiet, guitars are too loud",
  "The voice is too low compared to the other instruments",
  "mixed by a bass player?",
  "This lacks a bit of punch, and there seems to be an EQ effect on it that makes it sound a bit distorted/played over bad speakers",
  "Bass-heavy",
  "instrument volume is too loud",
  "I hear a lot of vocals, a bit less guitar, and somewhere far back, drums. There's little definition, and unfortunately, I don't hear any effects.",
  "Too little drum (way too few toms).",
  "Sounds quite LoFi.",
  "The mix lacks focus in its balance choices: I don't know where to listen... In the verse, where the vocals are not very intelligible (which doesn't contribute to the emotion and is somewhat frustrating), they are suddenly placed loudly in the chorus. The choice of the snare sound is interesting but is too static to fulfill its role as an anchor. In mono, the mix loses a lot of its strength, and the strange balance choices become more apparent.",
  "Many guitars, strange EQ especially in the midrange, making it sound like it's coming through a radio.",
  "Guitars sound a bit messy at times but are audible. Vocals are not very clear at the beginning. In the chorus, the vocals come in quite abruptly and are too loud, which I don't find pleasing. The vocals are not deep enough in the mix during the chorus. I miss a bit of sub and cymbals. The balance of the drums is not quite right; cymbals and toms are too quiet compared to the kick and snare. The balance could be better overall.",
  "Lacking body, vocals get lost in the mix. Quite dry.",
  "This mix could use a bit more brightness. In my opinion, the drums don't bring enough energy as they are now. It sounds somewhat dry, and I miss some punch in the drums.",
  "Too few drums. The guitars are prominent but don't sound good, not clear. The vocals could also benefit from sounding clearer with more effects.",
  "Vocals too low. Guitar too loud. Generally very poor balance.",
  "No bottom end, no high end. All midrange. Vocals are hidden behind the too-loud guitars",
  "Everything is too compressed, there is lack of dynamics, and it is too filtered, in particular low frequencies are too filtered",
  "too much cutting -",
  "sounds like everything is mixed from just 1 mic (singer's mic)",
  "Tinny with no bottom end...",
  "Doesn't get very clear until the vocal vocal bursts through. Guitar hard to hear correctly.",
  "\"Old tape\" mix?",
  "Attenuated frequencies at low and high end and mix centred around mid frequencies.Low level of excitement. Some grouping seems to happen between guitar and drums as the guitar sound seems to be cancelling the drums in the beginning.",
  "the vocal sound is too vague, and it sounds like lack of some harmonies.",
  "Sounds muddy",
  "guitar and drum is weird",
  "Vocals too high and dry - sounds flat and lifeless.",
  "A little tinny sounding",
  "Something's wrong with the eq on this one?",
  "That mix seriously lacks punch, I guess the drums should be more present",
  "Vocals a bit too much \"excited\" by some kind of tube-modelling",
  "Bad, unnatural midrange, sounds like an mp3",
  "The voice is too compressed should have a higher volume",
  "Low-pass filtered. Lost of definition. Feels like a highly compressed (in the audio coding sense) version.",
  "underwater",
  "doesn't sounds clear. very poor mastering",
  "Quite heavy and very dry vocals.",
  "Vocals a little lost in the drums.",
  "the vocal sound is a little bit vague",
  "Guitar/bass instruments sound \"fragile\" / dampened and fuzzy. Sounds like listening through a radio",
  "channel balance is kind of weird",
  "Vocals too distant due to the choice of reverb and also due to poor equalization, bass lacks presence, Hammond too loud at times.",
  "Mix lacking brightness overall. The stereo image is a bit confusing in the drums.",
  "Vocal seems to be coming out of a car radio... Very mid mix.",
  "Excessive drum presence and excessive use of reverbs. The drum elements sound distant from the musical field, just like the guitars are overly present for this formula. Lack of brightness in guitars and vocals. Excessive midrange in vocals. Lack of gain automation in vocals. Bass is missing.",
  "Guitars with excessive midrange, vocals lacking presence.",
  "Reverb too present. The mix loses strength by having too much space.",
  "Seems like i'm hearing this out of a tape deck.... I need to tilt my head to listen to this one... bad panning..",
  "Voice with too much reverb becomes too hidden among the other elements. Effect on the guitar doesn't help the mix. Too much reverb on the snare. Everything sounds very distant and lacks power.",
  "Excessive treatment of the vocals, creating a strange plasticity. Excessive presence compared to the other elements. We can't hear the other pieces of the drum kit besides the mid-highs from the overheads. Good bass balance. Excessive presence of the pianos.",
  "The drums should be more present; the bass is a bit too loud. The vocals have an excess of highs.",
  "The time-based effect on the vocals doesn't complement anything. Guitars are not very present. Lack of volume in the drums.",
  "Mix is quite boxed. drums and bass are so low and masked. some weird things are happening to the vocals. Again the keyboards seem to stand out.",
  "The effect on the vocals is too much. The mix, in general, is too muffled. The vocals are too prominent in the more intense part of the song. The drums are very hidden. It lacks enough strength to carry the song when needed.",
  "Excessive presence of keyboards and vocals. Guitars with a very strident tone. Excess of hi-hats in the chorus. Drum details are not heard with precision (lack of compression and gain boost).",
  "Weak mix, excessive overheads, poorly equalized snare, vocals lacking presence.",
  "Vocals are not well defined and lack presence. The synthesizer is detached from the mix. And there's a lack of body in the guitars and drums.",
  "It seems that someone forgot to mix this one. A lot of keyboard,",
  "I miss highs in the vocals. Too many mid-lows make the mix 'boring' and heavy. Crash cymbal is too loud in the chorus.",
  "Excessive drums, vocals, and backing vocals (especially in the chorus). Lack of work on the vocals (applying EQ to add more brightness, compressor to give more dynamic presence, and reverb to simulate the room that the original studio lacked). Missing guitars and bass lines.",
  "Bass not very present; vocals with an excess of midrange.",
  "The mix lacks a bit of strength. Background vocals take up too much space that belongs to the main vocals. The keys with delay add an interesting space.",
  "Needs a bit more vocals. The vocal seems a little dead. Drums don't have any punch to them. Guitars are a little \"low middy\". Back vocals are too loud when compared to the main vocal.",
  "The vocals could be a bit louder and slightly less dry. The keyboard element could be a bit higher in the verse to add more dynamism to the music. Drums in general could be louder, but paying attention to the cymbals. Choruses in the chorus are too loud. Crash cymbal too loud in the chorus.",
  "Excess midrange and the presence of overdriven guitars, perhaps due to the gain or pans excessively leaning to the left. Snare, toms, and kick drum have no presence in the mix, at the same time, there's a certain exaggeration in the presence of hi-hats in the chorus. The mix lacks body, needs EQ and compression on the Final Mix channel.",
  "The drums don't have any room to them. The vocal is quite low and masked by the other elements. the back vocals need to be tighter, and they seem to disappear in the mix. Mix tends to the left. The guitar in the middle 8 is quite loud.",
  "The definition of the elements helps to understand the music better. Guitar too loud, especially from the pre-chorus, stealing attention from the vocals. The vocals are not very present from the pre-chorus. Crash cymbal too loud in the chorus. If the vocals were slightly higher in the chorus, the mix would be, in my opinion, more balanced.",
  "Attempting to pull the guitar to the left highlighted it compared to the rest of the instruments, making things a bit strange. The vocals are not pleasant to listen to.",
  "The guitars and vocals are too loud compared to the rest of the instruments, making the predominant tone the midrange of the guitars and vocals, which makes the mix a bit aggressive. Despite the guitars being open (stereo), overall, the mix is not benefited because all the other information is too centered. The use of reverbs, especially on the drums, puts all the instruments quite distant and very separated, it doesn't seem like they are playing together.",
  "The spatialization helps the music. However, the processed vocals create something bizarre. The instrumental guitar section lacks body and highs: it becomes too thin...",
  "- Drums could be higher (especially kick and snare drum) - Solo guitar too high (compared to base guitar)",
  "Worst of the mixes, vocals with excessive effects, I can't even quite describe what it is. The bass seems to be the best within everything.",
  "The voice sounds strange, muffled, and the tambourine is too loud compared to the rest.",
  "The chorus should have compression to avoid so much variation. Chorus and vocals should be less present. And the voice is processed in an unorthodox way. There is a bright percussion instrument too present.",
  "The volume balance between instruments is quite unbalanced. The kick and snare are too loud compared to everything else. The use of reverb on the guitars makes the whole melody quite confusing and in a different space from the instruments. Overall, the mix seems very closed, with too much bass and little definition. Throughout the song, there are too many fluctuations in the dynamics of the voice, causing some words to be lost slightly at times.",
  "The drums are too muffled, the vocals lack interest. The drums are too loud, and the snare lacks definition.",
  "Not only the excessive reverb on the vocals, but they also panned the vocals to the L and R, making things even stranger.",
  "The volumes between the instruments are unbalanced, especially in the relationship between guitar, vocals, and snare. It has a lot of information in the center, making the mix a bit cluttered and lacking space. Timbrically, the mid-bass area is too filled, making the mix a bit cluttered and unclear. The use of effects, especially on the guitar, made its sound unclear and placed it slightly apart from the rest of the band. Overall, if the effects were improved or reduced, the mix would sound better.",
  "The equalization of the vocals is strange. It seems concentrated on the higher frequencies only.",
  "The vocals and guitar are louder than the rest of the instruments. All instruments seem overly processed and equalized, the mix lacks body. Especially the vocals have only high frequencies. The music has little dynamics and is overly compressed. All instruments seem centered, making the mix less interesting and small. Overall, the whole song feels distorted and overly filtered.",
  "- Missing some bass to the final mix - Back vocals too high - Bass guitar too low (could be higher and more powerfull) - Guitar too much on the right - Missing some reverb to the vocals",
  "Seems very compressed. The voice lacks any life. It sounds like it's compacted.",
  "I dislike an element of the drums that I can't identify, even listening to the other songs. It's present and a bit bothersome. A sound that seems like a 'scratching' of some sort. The guitar is a bit muffled.",
  "the panoramas don't satisfy me: the accompaniment of the voice shouldn't have been spatialized. The choir could have been stronger. The soloist's voice could have been worked on more.",
  "The bass is too low. It ends up overshadowing some of the other instruments.",
  "The vocals are too loud compared to the other instruments, and the drums are slightly low. The mix is somewhat muddled in terms of frequency and lacks definition. All sounds are heavily compressed, causing them to lose some character and timbre. The spatial aspects are underutilized, making the mix less engaging and confusing. Overall, the mix lacks more definition and presence in the low and high-frequency areas.",
  "Excessive vocals, pianos, and backing vocals in the chorus. Lack of presence in the drums (except for the overheads). Lack of equalization and compression work on the Mix Output to generate more weight and strength in the mids and lows. Lack of brightness and reverb in the vocals.",
  "Mix is a bit muffled. Keys are too prominent.",
  "Vocal is too low and needs a little less reverb.Keyboards are too loud, causing some pumping effect. Drums seem to be in the right place. Guitars seem ok. Keys sometimes cover the voice up.",
  "Voice is too muffled and low. The tail end of reverb in the voice is too audible. Keyboards might be a bit too loud compared to the guitar.",
  "Complete lack of low frequencies. Sounds like a low-quality stream. Despite that, in terms of overall balance, it seems interesting. Lack of bass presence. Excessive pianos in the chorus. Needs better work on the vocal lines (reverb and gain automation in the parts leading up to the chorus).",
  "Excessive mids and highs; kick almost not felt; snare lacking mid-lows; vocals",
  "Drums are well present. Mix too strident. Lacks body.",
  "Guitars are too bright, without low end at all, sound to thin. The vocal is quite thin also. The bass is a bit low, needs a bit mor roundness. The drums seem to have a bit too much room when the snare hits.",
  "The voice is too prominent and dry. The tambourine is too loud, stealing attention from the other elements. Low frequencies are not prominent enough. I miss the secondary voices that hold the music together between verses.",
  "Excessive presence of the main vocal for this mix, but it shows a good balance in the VOICE group and the INSTRUMENT group. There is a lack of balance application between these two groups.",
  "Very weak mix; low frequencies lacking presence, guitar clashing with the main vocal, tambourine too loud.",
  "Voice too loud and separated from the mix.",
  "Voice with too many mids, sounds too muffled. Tambourine too loud. A better balance between guitar and keys during the verse might help for a fuller sound. Snare drum very hidden.",
  "Terrible application of vocals throughout the track. Excessive presence of both vocals due to overly elevated panoramas. Vocal1 - left / vocal2 - right. Other elements, especially the drums, are too suppressed, lacking color and brightness. Insufficient dynamics between guitars and bass. Lack of low frequencies and definition in the bass. Missing equalization and compression in the guitar. Excessive panning in the guitars.",
  "The reverb is noticeable on the sibilants. The drums lack definition.",
  "What is happening to these vocals? This mix just seems to have no center. What is going on here? Very creative mix indeed. Terrible balance.",
  "The center becomes too empty when the vocals pan to the right and left. Panorama should be less extreme. The voice is too low during the first part of the song. Snare disappears in the second part of the song.",
  "I like the balance but the vocal is out of control, needs automation and maybe tuck it in a bit. Snare sounds dull and every hit is different. Organ is a bit too wide, not natural",
  "Not enough kick. Verb pushing the vox back too much. Pick a different vox verb.",

  "The vocal sound is lolder compared track 2 and track 0",
  "Too much compression on drum.",
  "Terrible resonance in the low mids, please kill it and burn the body. Vocals too loud and the instruments are a mess.",

  "Drums too far, really weird balance. not good.",
  "inst. seem distant/muddy",
  "Where are the drums?? Totally out of balance, all I hear is high hat, maybe a little snare. Verb is washy.",
  "Reverb on the keys makes it soupy. Vocal level a little upfront this big roomy thing behind it.",
  "Drums too quiet (especially kick).",
  "Reverb and voice a little high.",
  "This is an unorthodox mix. But the effect of muffling the backing instrumentation very nicely serves the lead vocals on the verse. It would be interesting to open the sound a little more on the chorus, that fails to get the lift it needs. There are strange abrupt volume changes in the instrumentation of the chorus. Caused by a bad balance of the ride cymbal vs. HH ?",

  "The record?!?",
  "Guitar lacks punch and the whole thing feels a bit quiet.",
  "mid range a bit muddy. Vocales can't cut through",
  "Sounds a bit messy, lacks separation.",
  "separated, voice masked by guitar",
  "flat, not sure about the vocal effect. Warm",
  "guitar and bass a bit loud, generally loud mid-low frequencies",
  "drum\u2019s sound too loud",
  "this mix is unclear and the voice is not strong.",
  "Lead a little harsh and loud. not a bad balance.",
  "Slide guitar?? Way too hot. Tiny snare. Vocals needs to leveled out way more....Words sticking out like crazy. Cool effect on the prochorus",
  "overcompressed vocals",
  "left slide guitar is an akward place, too forward and dry. vocals sound aggressive, too much 4k or something. guitars could be more gutsy.",
  "lead vocal not integrated",
  "De-ess vocal. Vocal too loud. Drums need to sound bigger. You messed up the timing in the prechorus, voice is delayed from you plugin chain.",
  "Unbalanced. Demo? Interesting ideas for the real mix?",
  "Too much treble",
  "Like the right pan of rhythm guitar. Can hardly hear tambourine. Bass seems a little thin.",
  "Vocals are overly-compressed at times.",
  "could have less compression, too much effect on vocals on second part",
  "Now the slide guitar is too present and panned to left. It creates some separation, but is not appealing. The chorus in the voice in part B is too extreme.",
  "The vocals sound a bit piercing.",
  "the balance is not good",
  "Too much guitar, especially the one on the far right. Not enough snare, and too much hi-hat.",
  "Open mix, but aggressive highs, possibly too much master compression? Hi-hat is too loud, and there's not enough snare.",
  "The vocals sound quite sharp.",
  "More of a rock feel. The vocals sound watery, and the drum balance doesn't sound familiar. The vocals don't sound good, quite thin.",
  "I miss a bit of kick. I think there's a bit too much very low end in the bass. There's little definition in the low frequencies.",
  "Bit too bright and thin",
  "Too bright, snare sounds like it is clipping at times",
  "A lot of noise is shadowing this mix. It very badly interferes with the distorted guitars and any loud sound really. Sounds very harsh to the ears, not pleasant to listen to.",
  "acid - with character but crackling?",
  "Vocals have a weird EQ on it",
  "vocals too thin, out of place, disappear in the music, highs annoying",
  "drum\uff0csome noise in track\uff0cnot comfortable",
  "music seemed coarse and false",
  "still separated.",
  "Way too much bass and too much hi-hat.",
  "Sounds quite dark.",
  "Too much bass! Vocals sound a bit dull. A lot of reverb on the guitars.",
  "Quite a bit of sub in the mix. The bass is too high, pushing everything away.",
  "A lot of low end, sounds muffled. It's difficult to discern the placement of bass and kick. Perhaps it was mixed in a space where low frequencies pose a challenge.",
  "The bass is really booming at a very low frequency. Quite disturbing. Also, the drums don't come through very well.",
  "Bass a bit too subby",
  "Missing the high end, too much bass",
  "I would appreciate some pannings, The guitar is too low",
  "Bass over-compressed. Too much hi-hat.",
  "very boomy mix (this is bad!). Vocals don't stand out, the bass masks most of the instrumentation, only the top end of the snare and cymbals manage to cut through.",
  "Too bright sounding maybe",
  "low sound range(?) is strong",
  "singer voice more miscible with music than track 0",
  "Big bottom end; borderline unruly but could be tweaked at mastering. Vocals a little bit lost, instrumental elements are mixed in a pleasant, unobtrusive manner.",
  "The guitar on the left demands too much attention.",
  "Omwille van de nadruk op elementen in het hoog, heeft deze mix haast geen mid informatie waardoor het geheel zwak klinkt. Plaatsing van de bas werkt goed, maar krijgt dan ook vrij spel omdat alle gitaren 'ondermixt' zijn. Een mix die meer op suggestie is gebaseerd dan concrete informatie.",
  "The mix sounds quite empty. Could use more body, not through the bass, but via other instruments.",
  "The drum sound doesn't really match the rest. Too much attack in the snare. Maybe this works well on a small monitoring system (PC speakers).",
  "The hi hat is harsh",
  "The voice is too low, the guitar should have a higher volume",
  "Harsh top end (heard a lot on HH and ride cymbal). The amount of compression applied (too much) squashes the sound. The mix does not have any air to breathe anymore. Vocals sound very thin and don't cut trough. Drums sound very thin as well (this is bad).",
  "thin image, guitar on its own - interesting",
  "thin and boxy and muddy, instruments not really discernible, drums too dry",
  "hi\uff0dhat too over",
  "Not mixed well, I can hear all the sound individually",
  "Bright mix, drums are weak and could use a dose of SSL G-series compression.",
  "In my opinion, the worst mix. I hear a lot of harshness in the snare. The kick is way too prominent. The balance between guitars and vocals is also off; the guitars often overpower the vocals. I also remember there being an acoustic guitar, but I won't be able to distinguish it.",
  "No nice low/low-mid in the mix; the bass drum sounds very flat, and the bassline disappears completely. Too much 800-2.5k in the mix, making it tiring to listen to.",
  "The vocals are drowned out by the guitars, which are too extreme left/right. It's the only one of the 7 where the bass drum comes through, but immediately too much.",
  "Vreemde EQ , gitaren luid , weinig top/open hoog. Weinig reverb.",
  "Don't like the kick. There's something in the low-mid that is disturbing. I miss some bass, it's not well-balanced with the kick. The snare doesn't sound good to me either. Guitars and vocals are well balanced. In this mix, the drum sound bothers me, which I consider a downside.",
  "Vocals are too buried in the mix. The balance is not quite right.",
  "Seems mixed by a guitarist. Kick and snare are quite loud. Vocals sit deep (perhaps due to the performance?)",
  "Drums a bit dry and guitar a bit loud",
  "Don't like the snare",
  "Guitars are too loud. Vocals are way too far back. The tonal balance is terrible.",
  "too wide and dry",
  "Unbalanced sound",
  "music too loud ,lack of texture,singer voice too weak",
  "No bass end at all. Mix balance is all off.",
  "This mixing sounds tiring because the voice of bass is a little high, I can't even hear the vocal clearly. And the rhythm is not consistent enough, so I think it's a bit poor.",
  "too separated .feel like the musical instrument performed in different place",
  "The guitars are a bit too prominent in my opinion, they are quite forward. It seems like the vocals sometimes have to compete with the guitars, as if they are working against each other. It makes it a bit tiring to listen to.",
  "I find the vocals sound quite dry and upfront in the mix. This clashes a bit with the guitars, which are also quite loud. There's a bit too much information in the 800-2k Hz range.",
  "The vocals don't really stand out in the mix, and there's too much hi-hat.",
  "Some things could be panned a bit more.",
  "The vocals have a strange midrange. Is there little compression on the vocals?",
  "A bit more drums. The song might be lacking some punch/low end.",
  "Not bad but vocals a bit low and a bit too much low-mid in the whole mix",
  "Not bad, cannot hear the acoustic guitar",
  "The voice should have a higher volume, the guitar seems to be too much filtered and compressed",
  "Too thin. Lacks some bass.",
  "Way too much reverb. All the focus and clarity is lost as a consequence. Vocals are diluted in it. This is a shame, the mix is decent otherwise.",
  "too much in front - bit flat",
  "vocals too dry",
  "low pitch sound too weak,lack of rhythm sensation",
  "the vocal is not clear.not highlighted"
